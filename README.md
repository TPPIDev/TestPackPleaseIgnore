"Test Pack Please Ignore" -FTB Modpack
===============

A github for public updates to the pack. We have a subreddit at http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPackPleaseIgnore/ . Thanks for reading!

Information
===============
"Test Pack Please Ignore" is a FTB pack made by members of the FTB reddit, officialy given the OK by Slowpoke himself.

To get the pack, enter the code "MegaSharkPunch" (no quotes) into the FTB private packs option.

This pack runs best with at least 2.5 GB memory, and 256 MB of permgen. To set the permgen, go to the options tab and click on "Advanced Options". In additional java parameters, add the following (without the quotes): "-XX:PermSize=256M".

When you enter a new world, our book, like the Tinker’s Construct one, will show up in your inventory. Read it!

Bug Reports: Submit all bug reports on our github here: To open up an issue, simply click the “new issue” green button near the top right of the screen in the issues menu, fill out the subject/title and the body paragraph. What does a good bug report look like?
1. Steps to reproduce.
2. If the game crashed, or if one of the developers ask you to, a copy of your log on some sort of paste website. I recommend http://paste.ubuntu.com/, to allow for maximum characters.
3. Screenshots, if the issue warrants it and for clarification.

REMINDER: THIS IS A BETA AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH.

Any questions/comments/concerns can be brought up on our IRC here: http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=TestPackPleaseIgnore&prompt=1/#btn. For everything else you need to know, you can find the information on our own subreddit here: http://www.reddit.com/r/testpackpleaseignore.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, have fun :)
