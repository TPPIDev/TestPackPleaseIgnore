"Test Pack Please Ignore" -FTB Modpack
===============

A Git repository for public updates to the pack. We have a subreddit at http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPackPleaseIgnore/ . Thanks for reading!

Information
===============
"Test Pack Please Ignore" is a FTB pack made by members of the FTB reddit, officialy given the OK by Slowpoke himself.

To get the pack, enter the code "MegaSharkPunch" (no quotes) into the FTB private packs option.

This pack runs best with at least 2.5 GB memory, and 256 MB of permgen. To set the permgen, go to the options tab and click on "Advanced Options". In additional java parameters, add the following (without the quotes): "-XX:PermSize=256M". If using Java 8, setting permgen is not required.

~~~~ Obsolete ~~~~

_Upon launching the pack for the first time, you will be prompted with a GUI popup to download additional mods that we unfortunately didn't have permission to redistribute in our pack. Following the directions on the GUI will allow you to easily download the additional mods and place them in the correct directory folders. This is an optional process, but *highly* recommended to get the full TPPI experience. DO NOT CLOSE YOUR MINECRAFT UNTIL PROMPTED TO._

_Reminder for ad.fly: In the upper right hand corner of your window you will see text go from “please wait” to “5”->”4”…”1” then “SKIP AD”. Do not click anything on your screen except for that yellow “SKIP AD” button. This will automatically download Thaumcraft into your assigned download folder. Drag the newly downloaded mod into your mods folder, which can easily be opened by clicking the button on the GUI. Repeat for Twilight Forest by clicking “continue”._ 

_After completion, the GUI will ask you to close the game: do so. After, simply relaunch with the same version and all of the mods will successfully load._

_SERVER OWNERS: Your players may have questions about this, refer them here or explain it to them yourself. Now, how will you server owners get Twilight Forest+Thaumcraft? You can either download the latest versions from the respective forum threads, or go through the same process as your clients and install them with our GUI after you launch the game._

When you enter a new world, our book, like the Tinker’s Construct one, will show up in your inventory. Read it!

Bug Reports: Submit all bug reports on our github here: To open up an issue, simply click the “new issue” green button near the top right of the screen in the issues menu, fill out the subject/title and the body paragraph. What does a good bug report look like?
1. Steps to reproduce.
2. If the game crashed, or if one of the developers ask you to, a copy of your log on some sort of paste website. I recommend http://paste.ubuntu.com/, to allow for maximum characters.
3. Screenshots, if the issue warrants it and for clarification.

REMINDER: THIS IS A BETA AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH.
