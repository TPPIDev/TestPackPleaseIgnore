**This is the file of supported mods and the info to go along with them**
**To add a mod to the file, type >ModCommandName, ModProperName<**
**The ModCommandName cannot have spaces, and will be used to call the mod's info command.**
**The ModProperName can have spaces - this is the "real name" of the mod, to be used in its guidebook title.**
**Example: >ThermalExpansion, Thermal Expansion 3<**
**After that, type any info about the mod. Mod information is naturally separated by the names of mods (inside ><)**
**To just specify a link, use <> (ex. <http://google.com>) and this will be put into the chat instead of a book**
**You CANNOT have a mod's documentation be both a book and a link, due to current limitations of the mod**
**That means, for mods where you want to link to a wiki, the link should be all that's there under it in this**
**documentation file.**
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

***15
Example:
>ModName<
This is some very useful info
and I am typing it on multiple lines 
to make this text file easier to read. 
These lines don't have line breaks between them 
in the book though because they don't end with "~".
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line
>ModName2<
<http://google.com>

**Begin line after asterisks**

>Builcraft, Buildcraft 4<
Buildcraft adds a load of cool ways to automate crafting, processing, and mining.~
~
This mod adds "engines" which are ways to produce MJ. You can also use Thermal Expansion's dynamos,
but you must have an energy conduit between the dynamo and the machine.~
~
There are many different machines, for instance, the quarry. The quarry is an semi-automatic way to mine. You can use
landmarks to set the size of the quarry, but keep in mind 64x64 is the maximum size. The automatic crafting table crafts
stuff, automatically! Totally unexpected!
~
You can also use pipes to transport items, for instance you can make a automated smelter. If you want to learn better,
just start practicing and you'll get the hang of it, or you can watch a mod spotlight.
~

>TinkersConstruct, Tinkers' Construct<
Tinkers' Construct is a mod that lets you build custom tools out of 
various materials, each with their own special properties.~
~
To get started with the basics, check out the book "Materials And You" that 
you should have spawned with.
~

>ArsMagica, Ars Magica 2<
Ars Magica 2 is a very polished and developed magic mod with RPG elements.~
~
This mod comes with its own in-game guide! To get this guide, craft an Item Frame and
a normal Book, and get exploring: you'll have to find liquid Essence.~
~
Essence is a cyan liquid found in small pools in forests and similar biomes.
~~~
To get the in-game guide, find a pool of Essence, place the Item Frame so that it is directly above
the pool of Essence, and place the Book inside the Item Frame. After some flashes and sparkles,
your guidebook will be ready.

>GregTech, GregTech<
<gregtechcommunitywiki.wikispaces.com>
**GregTech is far, far too complex for Minecraft's Written Book format.**
**I think the only way to provide support for that mod is either a wiki link**
**Or a book format resembling Thaumcraft's or RotaryCraft's.**

>MFR, MineFactory Reloaded<
MineFactory Reloaded is a vast mod, comprising many useful 
machines and automation devices.  From conveyor belts to tree farms, 
there is something in MFR for everybody.~
~
To get started, most of the MFR machines require rubber.  Rubber trees are 
generated throughout the landscape.  Break the wood to acquire the flexible 
material, then smelt it into rubber bars, and then again into raw plastic.  
This plastic can then be crafted into sheets of plastic, which are the foundation 
for most of the machines.

>Thaumcraft, Thaumcraft 4<
Thaumcraft is a magical mod that requires you to "research" its items before you can craft them.~
~
There's all kinds of magical swag that you can build and play with, but it's probably best for you to 
learn about it on your own.~
To get started, craft a iron capped wooden wand, 
place a bookshelf on the ground, and right-click your wand on it.~
~
It should transform into a Thaumonomicon; the true guidebook for Thaumcraft!
~
 
>ThermalExpansion, Thermal Expansion 3<
Thermal Expansion is a "technology" mod that adds a power system called Redstone Flux (RF). 
It has itemducts, fluiducts, and energy conduits for transporting items, liquids, and RF power 
respectively, as well as a bunch of useful blocks for ore processing, automatic crafting, storage, and more.~
~
You can start generating RF power using the mod's dynamos and some energy conduits, with leadstone conduits being the 
lowest tier. 
You can rotate and pick up machines by right clicking and shift right clicking with a Crescent Hammer, 
the mod's version of a wrench.~
~~~
All machines in the mod have their own configuration settings in their GUIs.~
~
The redstone behavior tab lets you choose how the machine will respond to redstone.~
The configuration tab lets you choose where the machine will input and output its products, 
be that energy, liquids, or power, on a per block face basis.~
~
Blue indicates an input on a given face, while orange indicates an output.~
There are other colors used situationally depending on the machine. 
For these, it's best to select that color in the configuration menu, then look 
back at the main GUI of the machine.~
The slot in the machine associated with that color will 
be highlighted in that color. This should help indicate what that color's purpose is 
for that particular machine.
~
>TPPITweaks, TPPI Tweaks<
TPPITweaks is the mod made especially for the TPPI Modpack, 
which is the representative modpack for /r/feedthebeast.~
~
It contains many tweaks for mods to better improve balance, 
and some helpful objects to better guide
~~~
the player in the modpack.~
