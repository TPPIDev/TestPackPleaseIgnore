**This is the file of supported mods and the info to go along with them**
**To add a mod to the file, type >ModCommandName, ModProperName<**
**The ModCommandName cannot have spaces, and will be used to call the mod's info command.**
**The ModProperName can have spaces - this is the "real name" of the mod, to be used in its guidebook title.**
**Example: >ThermalExpansion, Thermal Expansion 3<**
**After that, type any info about the mod. Mod information is naturally separated by the names of mods (inside ><)**
**To just specify a link, use <> (ex. <http://google.com>) and this will be put into the chat instead of a book**
**You CANNOT have a mod's documentation be both a book and a link, due to current limitations of the mod**
**That means, for mods where you want to link to a wiki, the link should be all that's there under it in this**
**documentation file.**
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

***15
Example:
>ModName<
This is some very useful info
and I am typing it on multiple lines 
to make this text file easier to read. 
These lines don't have line breaks between them 
in the book though because they don't end with "~".
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line
>ModName2<
<http://google.com>

**Begin line after asterisks**

>Thaumcraft, Thaumcraft 4<
Thaumcraft is a magical mod that requires you to "research" its items before you can craft them.~
~
There's all kinds of magical swag that you can build and play with, but it's probably best for you to 
learn about it on your own.~
To get started, craft a iron capped wooden wand, 
place a bookshelf on the ground, and right-click your wand on it.~
~
It should transform into a Thaumonomicon; the true guidebook for Thaumcraft!
~
>TinkersConstruct, Tinkers' Construct<
Tinkers' Construct is a mod that lets you build custom tools out of 
various materials, each with their own special properties.~
~
To get started with the basics, check out the book "Materials And You" that 
you should have spawned with.

>ThermalExpansion, Thermal Expansion 3<
Thermal Expansion is a "technology" mod that adds a power system called Redstone Flux (RF). 
It has itemducts, fluiducts, and energy conduits for transporting items, liquids, and RF power 
respectively, as well as a bunch of useful blocks for ore processing, automatic crafting, storage, and more.~
~
You can start generating RF power using the mod's dynamos and some energy conduits, with leadstone conduits being the 
lowest tier. 
You can rotate and pick up machines by right clicking and shift right clicking with a Crescent Hammer, 
the mod's version of a wrench.~
~~~
All machines in the mod have their own configuration settings in their GUIs.~
~
The redstone behavior tab lets you choose how the machine will respond to redstone.~
The configuration tab lets you choose where the machine will input and output its products, 
be that energy, liquids, or power, on a per block face basis.~
~
Blue indicates an input on a given face, while orange indicates an output.~
There are other colors used situationally depending on the machine. 
For these, it's best to select that color in the configuration menu, then look 
back at the main GUI of the machine.~
The slot in the machine associated with that color will 
be highlighted in that color. This should help indicate what that color's purpose is 
for that particular machine.
