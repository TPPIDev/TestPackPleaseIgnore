- Yay, more fixes \o/~
~
- Actually fixed libraries this time~
~
- Updated Thaumic Reliquary to v1.1.1. MCPC compat.~
~~~

~~~
- Reverted (and updated) Chisel to 1.5.1. Most of your problems should be gone.~
~
- Updated TPPItweaks to 1.0.0-10. Fixes IC2 issues, adds some security to the txt reading.~

~~~

~~~

~~~
TPPIv1.0.1PreRelease~
~
- Hotfix for broken libraries~
~
- Enable Minetweaker on client
~~~
TPPIv1.0PreRelease~
~
- Yes, it is true! This is hopefully the last beta version. We feel confident enough in the balance and stability of the pack to fully release this in what will hopefully be the next version!~
~~~
- Removed Gascraft~
~
- Added Botania. Vazkii is back with his newest mod. We think you will enjoy this one. Note, this mod has worldgen, so you will either need to explore new chunks.~
~~~
- Added ElectroMagicTools. This is a Thaumcraft4/IC2 addon which brings new IC2-like content to the world of Thaumcraft. Find all of the info inside the thaumonomicon.~
~~~
- Added Minetweaker, disabled by default. Server owners, and even some SSPers, this is for you.~
~~~
- Added Forbidden Magic. This is another Thaumcraft addon which brings about the darker side of Thaumcraft. You will also find some integration with other mods like AM2, and Blood Magic. Again, check your thaumonomicon.~
~~~
- Added Thaumic Reliquary. This replaces all Reliquary items with their Thaumcraft-like varient. Reasearch, various TC crafting techniques like infusion and the arcane-worktableing, and even TC items will be required for this mod.~
~~~
- We think is a really good fit for Reliquary. Note: Server owners, if you wish, there is an option in the config, which is disabled by default, that allows players, if they so choose, to disable, but not really disable, this mod from having any effect.~
~~~
- It will have to be enabled on the server and the other option will have to be enabled on the client. This is great because not everybody will be a huge fan of this like we are. This is much better than having to disable the mod. It is up to you now!~
~~~
- Updated Big Reactors to v0.3.0A. Reactor mechanics have been completely rewritten-smaller reactors will heat up more, fuel consumption has been increased, and active cooling with Reactor Coolant Ports. Added multiblock turbines.~
~~~
Check out the Big Reactor website for a full list of changes.~
~~~
- Updated Blood Magic to v1.0.0. Full release time, so this means a new spell system, Ballad of the Alchemy, more alchemy recipes, and NEI integration.~
~
- Updated BC Colour Router Addon to v0.3.4. Couple minor bug fixes.~
~~~
- Updated MFFS/CalclaviaCore/UEcore to v3.6.2.59, v1.2.0.312, and v3.1.0.74 respectively. Too many changes to list here. Check out the UE website for more info. We were running quite an outdated version.~
~~~
- Updated Carpenters Blocks to v2.0.8. Fixed crashes and some bugs, particularly a nasty BoP crash. Added BlockRotatedPillar as a rotatable block, dynamic partial depth ambient occlusion, ability for slope selection while in hand-shift+scroll wheel.~
