**This is the file that TPPI Tweaks reads its info from, it is used for changelogs and information on the modpack**
**To add to the file, type what you want, and separate pages by using the phrase ~~~ **
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

***12
Example:
This is some very useful info
And I am typing it on multiple lines
to make this text file easier to read.
These lines don't have line breaks between them
in the book though because they don't end with "~".
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line

**Begin book text after asterisks**

Greetings lovely beta testers, and welcome to TPPI! 
We're really excited to bring this pack to you all.~
~
Hopefully, if this testing period goes smoothly, 
we'll be able to bring it to a lot more people soon!~
~
<3
~~~
This book that you've spawned with is a welcome packet of sorts, 
added by our own cute little mod called TPPI Tweaks.~
~
It will always contain the most up-to-date information 
on the pack, including the latest changelog, so check it 
often!
~~~
The text updates automatically when you open it, so you don't have to 
worry about having to craft a new one each release.~
~
Should you want a new copy, you can craft one with an iron ingot and three paper.
~~~
Another feature of TPPI Tweaks is the in-game commands it adds.~
~
We're working on a project to add in-game documentation for all 
the mods in the pack, to be accessed via commands.
~~~
Type /tppi mods <modname> to view a mod's current documentation, 
and /tppi mods list to see what mods we have documented so far.~
~
Naturally, this is a big job, and it's not yet finished.
~~~
It is our hope that the beta testing team will get 
involved in documenting these mods via our mod's system.~
~
If you'd like to help out, the github link 
for the file that generates the documentation is in the beta reddit's sticky.
~~~
Additionally, the /tppi ores command will give you a book on TPPI's unique layer-based 
ore generation system.~
~
Judge has worked really hard on it, 
and we in devland think it's really cool!
~~~
Have fun! And give us those bug reports :P.~
