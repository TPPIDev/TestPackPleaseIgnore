    S:"Book.Cover up!.Name"=Cover up!
    S:"Book.Cover up!.Page00"=Have you ever wondered how the Cover System works? This Book is about how to Cover your Machines up properly. But what does a Cover do, except fancy looking? And how to install Covers? And what If you want to remove the Cover?
    S:"Book.Cover up!.Page01"=Usually every regular Plate like Advanced Alloy, Refined Iron or Bronze Plates can be used as Cover. Even Covers of other Companies can be supported as well. To place a Cover, just get one and rightclick the Machine with it.
    S:"Book.Cover up!.Page02"=Covers can do many things such as improving Machines (see Upgrade Dictionary for Details), but their main purpose is preventing interactions between adjacent Blocks.
    S:"Book.Cover up!.Page03"=To remove a Cover, you need a Blue Crowbar or something similar, like a Red Crowbar for example. Just use the Crowbar on it, to get it back. If you want to adjust Upgrade Covers, you need a Screwdriver. Just screw around until you are set.
    S:"Book.Cover up!.Page04"=If you are low on Materials, but really need a Cover, then just take your Screwdriver and unscrew the outer hull of the Machine, turn it around, screw it back on and viola, you got a Cover for free.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Name"=Crop Dictionary V3.03a
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page00"=This is a List of all Crops I stumbled upon my tests. Some mutations of them had quite dangerous properties, which almost killed me, so be aware and don't use experimental WeedEx, like I did.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page01"=The generic Crops, like Pumpkins, Melons, Wheat, Sugar Canes, Cacti, Carrots, Potatoes, Nether Wart, Roses, Dandelions, Cocoa, Brown Mushooms and Red Mushrooms are not being further described here as they are commonly known.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page02"=Weed. The most dangerous Plant. It grows on empty Crop Sticks, which are very likely used for cross breeding. This Plant will spread over to other non-Weed Plants and assimilate them in a bad way. Use WeedEx on empty sticks to protect them.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page03"=Warning: Highly advanced Crops (fast growing ones) can behave like Weed but are immune to it as well. So you might want to make sure that your good Plants are seperated from nonresistent Plants.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page04"=Hops. A plant primary used to brew Beer. Nothing much to say about it.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page05"=Coffee. Well, it grows Coffee Beans, which can then be blended into Coffeee Powder to make Coffee.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page06"=Indigo. This Plant is giving you Indigo Blossoms, which can either be used for Blue Dye or Plant Balls. Four of these can also be used to plant new Indigo Plants. They are not Redpower compatible.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page07"=Flax. A Plant to give you just Strings. You can easyly get it via cross breeding. It is also not Redpower compatible.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page08"=Stick Reed. That Reeds are sticky. Perfect for making Rubber from them.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page09"=Terra Wart. It is like edible Milk. It cures all Poisons.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page10"=Red Wheat. It's Red, it's Wheat, it drops Redstone Dust.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page11"=Trollweed, uhh I mean Ferru. Grows Iron. Yes, real Iron. Only condition for that is having an Iron Ore Block under the tilled Farmland.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page12"=Coppon. Cotton Candy, I mean Cotton Copper, is an easy way to get Copper from Plants.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page13"=Tine. Name comes from Tin and Pine. This tiny Tree drops Tin Nuggets, yay. Perfect for Tinpinchers.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page14"=Plumbilia. This Heavy Metal Plant seems to like Music. It drops very dense Lead Nuggets, instead of the Bass.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page15"=Argentia. Silver. Well, at least it's something.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page16"=Aurelia. GOLD!!! It looks like trollweed, but instead of Iron it is Gold. Same for the Ore Block under it.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page17"=Oil Berries. These Vine alike Crops are dropping Oil Berries. Four Oil Berries can be put into a Cell to get an Oil Cell.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page18"=Bobsyeruncleranks. Because Bob is your Uncle. Drops Emeralds and Emerald Dust.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page19"=Withereed. Drops Coal. Real Coal, not that cheap Charcoal.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page20"=Blazereed. I think a Blaze Spawner is better than this.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page21"=Diareed. A Direwolfs way to get Diremonds.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page22"=Eggplant. Seems that there is a Chicken hiding somewhere in your Field.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page23"=Corium. This Leathery Plant lets you safe the Life of a Million innocent Cows, what practically ruins the Environment, due to the Methane output of these not so innocent Animals.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page24"=Corpseplant. Plants vs. Zombies went a bit wrong. Maybe this Zombie Plant wants to infiltrate your Garden.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page25"=Creeperweed. General Spaz experimented with Crops as well, to finally get rid of Etho. This Plant made it possible for him, to gather TNT without killing his good Friends.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page26"=Enderbloom. Seems the Ender Dragoon, made it finally into cross breeding, and this Ender Flower is what he got.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page27"=Meatrose. This is how to get Meat the beautiful Way, without needing to slaughter harmless Animals.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page28"=Milkwart. Use a Bucket to harvest this Plant.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page29"=Slimeplant. So it's a Tree, and it grows Slimeballs. A very bouncy Plant.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page30"=Spidernip. Cats looo ...wait, this isn't Catnip... , Spiders looooove this Plant. They just can't stop making their Webs in there.
    S:"Book.Crop Dictionary V3.03a.Page31"=Tearstalks. This Plant drops the probably rarest Item of all. Ghast Tears. These Tears are extremly rare, I guess even more rare than Nether Stars as they can't just be farmed, well, until now.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Name"=Geology Vol. 1
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page00"=In this Book I explain to you how to find Ores, and where to find Ores under normal circumstances. I don't guarantee you to find anything after you read this Book, but your chances should be higher after that.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page01"=First of all you need the proper equipment. You should have at least one Prospectors Hammer with you to find out if there are Ores close by. Just hammer onto regular Rock and you will see if there are traces of whatever Ore.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page02"=But not only that, you can also hear if there is something behind this Rock, like Water, Lava or a Cave. Or Silverfish if you are unfortunate. If you find traces of the Ore you are looking for you should Dig out the Area around you to find it.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page03"=As soon as you found the Ore, take a Sign, paint a Picture of whatever Ore you found on it, place it down, yell Yipee and send your Boss a Letter about you finding the Ore. That's how I do it, and I did my Job very well.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page04"=But now about where to find the Ores in the normal World. Some Ores can only be found in certain Areas, they behave as follows:
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page05"=Coal Ore: You can find it almost everywhere, in fact it is everywhere.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page06"=Iron Ore: This can only be found Underground below Ocean Level.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page07"=Gold Ore: It is usually found below Y-Level 32 deep Underground.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page08"=Redstone Ore: Is usually deep Underground below Y-Level 16, but there are tons of it.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page09"=Diamond Ore: You find it very deep Underground, below Y-Level 16.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page10"=Emerald Ore: A very rare Ore, which can only be found in Mountainous Areas and below Y-Level 32 in form of single Blocks.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page11"=Galena Ore: This Silver and Lead containing Ore can be found anywhere below Y-Level 32 in large but rare Clusters.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page12"=Iridium Ore: Extremly rare. You can find it anywhere, but it is so rare that you won't find much of it.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page13"=Ruby Ore: Found only in very dry Areas, like Deserts and Wastelands for example. It is as common as Emerald Ore is in Mountainous Areas.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page14"=Sapphire Ore: It is like Ruby Ore as common as Emerald Ore, but Sapphires are found under Oceans.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page15"=Bauxite Ore: It can be found above Y-Level 32 in Forests, Plains and other Areas with 'normal' Temperature. You will never find any Bauxite at Diamond Layer.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page16"=Tetrahedrite Ore: Found above Y-Level 32 in Mountainous Biomes, Jungles and Swamps. I would go for the surface Layers, as there is even more Ore above Y-Level 70, so Mountainous areas are perfect.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page17"=Cassiterite Ore: Found above Y-Level 32 in Mountainous Biomes, Icy Biomes and Mushroom Biomes. I would go for the surface Layers, as there is even more Ore above Y-Level 70, so Mountainous areas are perfect.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page18"=Nickel Ore: Between Y-Level 10 and 32 and can only be found in Mountainous Areas.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page19"=Sphaletire Ore: This can only be found under the Lava Lakes at Bedrock Level, and then there is only a small chance that you actually find it there. I heard that you can find tons of it in the Nether.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page20"=Black Granite: Very hard Rock, but also very valuable, as it contains few amounts of additional Iridium, Cooperite and Tungstate. Not to mention its Blast Resistance and cool Black look.
    S:"Book.Geology Vol. 1.Page21"=Red Granite: Very hard Rock, and kind of valuable, as it contains traces of Sphalerite, Cinnabar and Tetrahedrite. Not to mention, that this is Granite as well.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Name"=Greg-OS Manual I
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Page00"=Redstone Circuits are the main Component of a well running Base. The GregTech Redstone Circuit Block is ideal for processing Logic. It can compute everything! From a simple and consistent Timer to the Combo Lock on your Door!
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Page01"=It has a very simple interface. You just need to push as few Buttons, and you are good to go. Just don't forget to push the Start-Button right under the Energy Flow Button, after you adjusted your Configuration.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Page02"=Every Redstone Circuit has a diffrent Energy consumption. Yes, running this Device needs Energy, as indicated by the small blinking Lightning Bolt on the Screen. The needed Energy is just one Energy Unit per outputted Redstone Pulse.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Page03"=To switch between diffrent Redstone Circuits, just push the Button under the start Button. It looks like two sidewards pointing Arrows. The Lightning Bolt Button causes the Machine to output its Energy to the Block on its output Side.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Page04"=The four Buttons on the Left are controlling the System Parameters of the Redstone Circuit. You only need to right/leftclick them to adjust the Value. If you have an ItemStack in your Hand, then it copies a special Value into the selected Parameter.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Page05"=If you have something like an AND-Gate, and need to limit the Inputs for that, just place a Redstone preventing Cover on that Side. Any Cover will work, but since you need to power the Block from one Side you should use a special Cover for that.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Page06"=Said special Cover is the Redstone Preventor Cover, which can be attached by clicking twice with a Screwdriver on a Machine. That Cover looks Red and lets everything go through except Redstone Signals.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Page07"=It is always a good Idea to leave one Meter space between Circuits (that doesn't loose RS Strength), unless you directly connect the Output of a Circuit Block to the Input of another.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Page08"=The Player Detector, also called Player Proximity Sensor, is operating on a similar OS. The Strength of its Output Signal depends on the distance to the Configured Player, It allows you even to scan a piece of written Paper to select the target.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Page09"=The Redstone Display works also with said Operating System. It is specialized on showing you the incoming Redstone Signals. If you want to change its Format, just use a Screwdriver on its front, you can also 'paint' it with a Color of choice.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Page10"=The Redstone Controlled Lamp, which can also be painted, is glowing depending on the Strength of the incoming RS Signal. To make it constantly glow, just attach a Redstone Signalizer or a Redstone Torch to it.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual I.Page11"=The Button Panel is the best choice of Inputting Redstone Signals. Depending on which Button you press it outputs a Signal from 0-15. With a Controller Cover, or a Rubber Hammer, you can make the Buttons sticky.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Name"=Greg-OS Manual II
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Page00"=List of Logic Circuits
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Page01"=Basic Logic, Part I: This contains many simple Logic Gates. The first Six are basic Logic Gates. If you want to block any Inputs from it, then just screw a Redstone blocking Cover on said Side. These Gates take Input from all uncovered Sides.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Page02"=Basic Logic, Part II: Number Seven does 15 minus strongest Redstone. The following 6 Bit Gates are outputting what the binary Operators do. They take the strongest and the weakest Redstone Signal and compare them. Make sure to cover all unused Sides!
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Page03"=Basic Logic, Part III: The 14th Gate inverts the strongest incoming Restone Signal, using the Bitwise Inversion Operator '~'
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Page04"=BitAND: This is a special hardcoded BitAND. It does what a normal BitAND does and checks if the Output doesn't equal 0, to give a boolean Output. Very useful in combination with the Button Panel.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Page05"=Equals: Checks if the strongest Redstone Signal is equal to the set Value. Can also be inverted to check if it is unequal.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Page06"=Combination Lock: You need to apply 1 - 4 Redstone Signals of a certain Strength in a row to let this Pulse once. You can attach a Button Panel to this to get a Lock for your Door.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Page07"=Pulse Limiter: This is a Pulse Limiter, which outputs one Pulse regardless how long the Input Signal is. Also the output Pulse Length can be configured.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Page08"=Randomizer: Outputs Random Redstone Signals. The Interval to determine a new Random Number can be configured.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Page09"=Redstone Meter: This checks if a Signal is larger than the lower boundary and lower than the upper boundary. The Output can be Inverted.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Page10"=Repeater: This does what a normal Repeater does. It just delays an incoming Redstone Signal.
    S:"Book.Greg-OS Manual II.Page11"=Timer: This Gate is very useful. It pulses every X Ticks, and unlike it's extremly crappy Counterpart of Redpower it is CONSISTENT. It doesn't just loose its Timing, as soon as someone uses a Bed or Logs out. Also much more things can be configured.
    S:"Book.GregTech Energy Systems V3.04b.Name"=GregTech Energy Systems V3.04b
    S:"Book.GregTech Energy Systems V3.04b.Page00"=This Book explains Core Functionality of GregTech Machines. You might not understand it, but it can help you in some Cases.
    S:"Book.GregTech Energy Systems V3.04b.Page01"=As you know, GregTech Machines can run on 4 diffrent Energy Systems. Energy Units and Universal Electricity are natively compatible without Upgrades and are stored in the Electric Capacity. MJ and Steam need Upgrades and have seperate Capacities.
    S:"Book.GregTech Energy Systems V3.04b.Page02"=All those 3 Capacities store their Energy in Universal Energy Units. These Energy Units are basically the converted Version of MJ, Steam and UE into the EU-System. They are stored in 3 Diffrent Capacities (UE and EU share as they are both Electricity)
    S:"Book.GregTech Energy Systems V3.04b.Page03"=If a Machine now needs Energy, it first checks the Universal Capacity of the MJ-Units and tries to consume them. If that fails it checks the Capacity of Steam and tries to consume that. If they both failed, then it uses the Capacity for Electricity.
    S:"Book.GregTech Energy Systems V3.04b.Page04"=As Machines usually check, if they even have enough Energy, before starting to work, they always check the one capacity, which has the largest amount of Energy. That includes the Energy Meter Cover, so you measure the largest Potential of the Machine.
    S:"Book.GregTech Energy Systems V3.04b.Page05"=Almost every Cover Upgrade, Generator or similar Device produces Electricity. Electricity is the only Energy, which can be outputted by GregTech Machines. Everything else will be stuck inside the Machine until it gets consumed.
    S:"Book.GregTech Energy Systems V3.04b.Page06"=In case of Steam, the Machine will be able to output it, but only if it is inside the regular Tank (when I happen to add Steam based Solar for example). The internal Steam Energy Tank can't output Steam.
    S:"Book.GregTech Machine Safety.Name"=GregTech Machine Safety
    S:"Book.GregTech Machine Safety.Page00"=As you probably know, every electric Machine can be quite fragile under certain circumstances. This Manual explains why your Machines could explode or burn down your Workshop, and how to prevent it.
    S:"Book.GregTech Machine Safety.Page01"=1. Do not use a Pickaxe or something else, what is not a Wrench, to dismantle an electric Machine. This will cause either an Explosion or a just broken Machine if you are very lucky.
    S:"Book.GregTech Machine Safety.Page02"=2. Keep your Machines away from any explosives! Every electric Machine will cause a chain reaction of Explosions when being broken like that.
    S:"Book.GregTech Machine Safety.Page03"=3. Keep your Machines away from Fire. The are inflammable and will explode, if exposed too long to adjacent Fires.
    S:"Book.GregTech Machine Safety.Page04"=4. Do not place your Machines outside. They must have a Roof or Rain and Thunder Storms will set them on Fire. A Cover ontop of an electric Machine is sufficient to prevent that, so your Solar Panels are automatically safe.
    S:"Book.GregTech Machine Safety.Page05"=5. Make sure, that the Maximum Input Voltage of a Machine is not exceeded. That will cause an immidiate Explosion.
    S:"Book.GregTech Machine Safety.Page06"=6. Do not let your Machines explode. If that happens, the Machine will overcharge the adjacent Wiring, what will cause all connected Machines to explode, unless they can receive 8192EU/p.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Name"=GregTech Manual I (Edition 4)
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page00"=So, this is probably your first time using a Product of GregTech Intergalactical, so you might ask yourself where to begin with? This World is very complex, and you may want to aquire a few basic Resources first.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page01"=You need many Resources to start with, as there are: Wood, Sticky Resin or Slimeballs, Sand, Clay, Silk, Food, Iron, Copper, Tin, Flint, Redstone, Coal (or another good Fuel for the Oven) and a bunch of Cobblestones would also be very useful.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page02"=All Resources aquired? Good, then cook your Ores, Food and Slimeballs in your Stone Oven, and build a Bed so that you can rest. Then you might need a Mortar for the production of Bronze Dust. Bronze is much better than wasting Iron.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page03"=So, now that you have a set of Tools, you can begin to make an Iron Oven out of your old Stone Oven. And then you can begin to produce Refined Iron, by smelting Iron Ingots again. Smelting Sticky Resin into Rubber is no longer possible.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page04"=You might noticed that you need Tools to make Plates from Ingots, and to sharpen Edges, in order to make most of the Metal Items. So craft yourself a Hammer from 6 Ingots and a stick, and then make 2 Plates and put them on a stick to create a File.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page05"=This File is used to create Tools, which need a sharp Edge on a Side, like Swords, Pickaxes, Shovels, Axes and Hoes. The Metal Tools are all crafted in said way. Only Tools made of Gems, or the Wood and Stone Tools don't need this to be crafted.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page06"=You can ofcourse use Tools made of Flint for now, what saves you a lot of Metal in the beginning. I would recommend you to use two Plates to make a Saw, so you can increase the yield of Planks and Sticks you get from a Log of Wood.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page07"=Now you have to get some Bronze going, before you can make any Machine. So either grab yourself a Mortar and make your Copper and Tin Ingots into Dust, or use the Hammer to crush Copper, Tin, Tetrahedrite or Cassiterite Ore into Dust.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page08"=Mix these Dusts at a 3-Copper to 1-Tin ratio and you will get Bronze. Tetrahedrite is not that pure, so I would recommend you to smelt it into Copper before using it. Smelt your Bronze Dust into Bronze and we can finally begin to make a Machine.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page09"=The Boiler is a simple Machine, which makes Steam out of Water, what will then power your other basic Machines. You need a Wrench to assemble most Machines, what is another 6 Ingots in a 'Y' Shape. The Boiler needs Water, so you need to get some.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page10"=It accepts only Coal, Charcoal and Coal Coke as Fuel. Coal Blocks will not fit into the Boiler! In case you somehow found Steel somewhere, you should use it instead of Bronze to craft the Boiler. But now we need a Steam consumer first.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page11"=There are Steam powered Versions of Compressor, Extractor, Furnace and Alloy Smelter, as well as a Sturdy Grinder (increases Ore yield slightly) and a Steam powered Forge Hammer (Hammer without durability problems). Build your Workshop with them.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page12"=The Steam Machines have a special Steam Output, that Output can be turned using a Wrench. Never obstruct that Output with ANYTHING, or the Machine will refuse to work! And also never stand right in front of that Output as hot Steam comes out of it.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page13"=Running a Steam Pipe into said Output is the most common mistake people do, as that is an Output and not an Input. But now back to the Workshop: You need a ton of Steel, so you need to make a Bronze Blast Furnace. That needs 100 Bronze Plates.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page14"=You need 32 Bronze Plated Bricks, each of them needs 3 Bronze Plates and 1 Brick Block, and then you need the 1 Block where you insert the Iron and the Coal (or Coal Coke) to be smolten into Steel, what needs 4 Plates and 4 Brick Blocks more.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page15"=One of these Blast Furnii (The official plural of Furnace) might not be enough. You should build another one right next to it. Since you can share the Outer walls of the Blast Furnii you need only 64 more Bronze Plates for the second one.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page16"=Once you got enough Steel you can finally begin to make electric Machines. All that took you a few Days I guess, but you have finally reached the electric Tier, and you can be proud of it, that you got so far.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual I (Edition 4).Page17"=A very big Note: The Bronze Blast Furnace does NOT need Steam Power. Even though it should be very obvious, since it is Coal powered and Pipes don't even connect to it, I needed to mention this, because some people actually tried that.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual II.Name"=GregTech Manual II
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual II.Page00"=You have your Basic Workshop and want to do amazing things with it? You wan't to build your first Fusion Reactor? Well, this is the wrong Book for that, but we are working on it. Before that we definetly need better ways of making Circuitry.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual II.Page01"=The Assembling Machine is perfectly suited for that. It can create Circuitry much cheaper than a normal Steve could do. If you don't have the needed Materials then go mining, and come back when you have crafted the Assembling Machine.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual II.Page02"=This Device cuts down your Copper Cable Costs and gives you the possibility to use more advanced Materials for Circuitry. The Assembler might need some time for that, but it's the quality which counts. Well, and you get more quantity.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual II.Page03"=You got it? Now build a Wiremill to make more Cables from Copper than you usually do by handcrafting. This increases your efficiency in producing Machines extremly. And people still complain about being too expensive...
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual II.Page04"=And now we can go to some of the advanced Functions of these Devices. They can automatically output their Content to adjacent Inventories, but not only that, they can also output their contained Energy to adjacent Machines!
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual II.Page05"=you just need to wrench the output Facing into the correct direction, and keep the first two Buttons inside the GUI enabled. You can also upgrade Macerator, Extractor, Compressor and E-Furnace, using a Conveyor Module to get these abilities.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual II.Page06"=Now we go for the Alloy Smelter. Have you been tired of macerating, crafting and smelting Metals to get Alloys? This Machine is the perfect way to get Alloys in just one step! Just put your Ingots into it, and it will smelt them together.
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual II.Page07"=The Printing Factory, is a perfect Way of printing your Papers. This Book was printed using such a Machine. It can not only copy Books or create Maps, it can also make Paper from Reeds or Wood Pulp, and is also capable of Coloring your Wool!
    S:"Book.GregTech Manual II.Page08"=Also interessting are Industrial Electrolyzer and Industrial Centrifuge. They are capable of seperating the components of several Dusts or Liquids. The Centrifuge can work with pumped Lava to produce several nice Metals from it.
    S:"Book.Microwave Oven Manual.Name"=Microwave Oven Manual
    S:"Book.Microwave Oven Manual.Page00"=You just got a Microwave Oven and asked yourself 'why do I even need it?'. It's simple, the Microwave can cook for just 100 EU and at an insane speed. Not even a normal E-furnace can do it that fast and cheap!
    S:"Book.Microwave Oven Manual.Page01"=This is the cheapest and fastest way to cook for you. That is why the Microwave Oven can be found in almost every Kitchen (see www.youwannabuyakitchen.ly).
    S:"Book.Microwave Oven Manual.Page02"=Long time exposure to Microwaves can cause Cancer, but we doubt Steve lives long enough to die because of that.
    S:"Book.Microwave Oven Manual.Page03"=Do not insert any Metals. It might result in an Explosion.
    S:"Book.Microwave Oven Manual.Page04"=Do not dry Animals with it. It will result in a Hot Dog, no matter which Animal you put into it.
    S:"Book.Microwave Oven Manual.Page05"=Do not insert inflammable Objects. The Oven will catch on Fire.
    S:"Book.Microwave Oven Manual.Page06"=Do not insert Eggs. Just don't.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Name"=Thermal Boiler Manual
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page00"=This Book explains how to set up and run your Thermal Boiler. We are not responsible for any Damage done by this Book itself nor its content.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page01"=First you need to craft the following things for a Thermal Boiler to Function: The Main Boiler Block, 20 Reinforced Machine Casings, two Input Hatches, two Output Hatches, a bunch of different Tools and a Maintenance Hatch.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page02"=To begin the building, lay out the first 3x3 layer of Machine Casings on the ground (with a Hatch in the Middle), then place the Boiler Block facing outward in the middle of one of the 3m wide Sides.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page03"=Now grab 3 other Hatches and place them on the remaining three 3m wide Sides also facing outwards. And now the four corners of the Machine need also a Machine Casing. There should only be a Hole left in the middle of the Cube.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page04"=So, now place a 3x3 of Machine Casings ontop, at the 3rd Layer with the last Hatch in the middle facing outwards as well.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page05"=When accessing the Boiler Block, it should now stop telling you, that the structure is incomplete (bottom Line of that Screen). Now go with a bunch of different Tools (Metal Hammer, Rubber Hammer, Screwdriver, Wrench, Soldering Iron and Crowbar)
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page06"=to the Maintenance Hatch and access it. After that you grab the 6 Tools and rightclick the Slot with each of them in your Hand in the Maintenance GUI. Note that you need Soldering Tin/Lead in your Inventory to use the Soldering Iron.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page07"=The Main Block should now tell you that you need to use the Rubber Hammer on it to (re)activate the Machine. The Rubber Hammer can enable and disable Machines. The Machine disables itself after something important broke.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page08"=If you want to use Lava with this Device, then you should add a Lava Filter to extract additional Resources from the Lava. If the Filter breaks, the Machine won't explode like a Turbine would. If you use molten Salt, then you won't need a Filter.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page09"=You will get Obsidian when processing Lava, however if a Filter is used, you will get sometimes an Ingot instead of a Block of Obsidian. When using molten Salt, you will get the Salt back.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page10"=So, now for the Maintenance. After a few Hours of running nonstop, your Boiler will get small Problems, which don't prevent it from running, these Problems just decrease Efficiency. Every Problem listed on the Screen does -10% Efficiency.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page11"=To fix these Problems, just go to the Maintenance Hatch and click with the problem corresponding Tool on the Slot to repair. If all six possible runtime Problems happen, the Machine will auto-shutdown no matter what. No Explosion, it's just stopping.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page12"=The Thermal Boiler will produce 800 Liters of Steam per tick for about 5 or 6 Liters of Water per tick at reaching 100% Efficiency. In case of Lava it consumes 1666 Liters every Second.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page13"=A Thermal Boiler is worth about 33 small Thermal Generators, and as the Boilers get much less Efficient, when not having enough Fuel, you should consider making a large Nether Pump for Lava, or a good Nuclear Reactor for molten Salt.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page14"=Input and Output Slots are fully optional, you can place multiple ones of them or even none on the Machine. A Machine without Input couldn't process any Recipes, while a Machine without Output just voids all outputted Items and Liquids.
    S:"Book.Thermal Boiler Manual.Page15"=It might be useful to use the Screwdriver on the Output Hatches to determine what is outputted where. Another Hint: You need exactly 2 Thermal Boilers to run a Steam Turbine properly.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Name"=Turbine Manual
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page00"=This Book explains how to set up and run your advanced Gas or Steam Turbine. We are not responsible for any Damage done by this Book itself nor its content.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page01"=First you need to craft the following things for a normal Turbine to Function: The Main Turbine Block, 28 Machine Casings (Gas = Reinforced, Steam = Standard), a Dynamo Hatch, an Input Hatch, an Output Hatch, a Turbine Rotor, 
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page02"=a bunch of different Tools, in case of the Gas Turbine (not needed for Steam Turbine) a Muffler Hatch, as every Machine, which burns things causes some unwanted Gasses and finally a Maintenance Hatch
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page03"=To begin the building, lay out the first 3x4 layer of Machine Casings on the ground, then place the Turbine Block facing outward in the middle of one of the two 3m wide Sides. Now 3 of the Casings should look like Rotors.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page04"=Now grab your Dynamo Hatch and place it on the opposite 3m wide Side also facing outwards. And now the four corners of the Machine need also a Machine Casing. You should have a 2x3 inbetween the two 'Walls' you just created left by now.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page05"=So, now place a 3x4 of Machine Casings ontop, at the 3rd Layer. The Turbine should now look like connected. There are 4 Spots left, place the Input, Output, Muffler (or another Machine Casing) and the Maintenance Hatch in the Spots facing outwards.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page06"=When accessing the Turbine Block, it should now stop telling you, that the structure is incomplete (bottom Line of that Screen). Now go with a bunch of different Tools (Metal Hammer, Rubber Hammer, Screwdriver, Wrench, Soldering Iron and Crowbar)
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page07"=to the Maintenance Hatch and access it. After that you grab the 6 Tools and rightclick the Slot with each of them in your Hand in the Maintenance GUI. Note that you need Soldering Tin/Lead in your Inventory to use the Soldering Iron.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page08"=The Main Block should now tell you that you need to use the Rubber Hammer on it to (re)activate the Machine. The Rubber Hammer can enable and disable Machines. The Machine disables itself after something important broke.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page09"=And we are now finally able to grab our Turbine Rotor and place it into the Turbine Block. You can repair the Rotor by just using Hammer and Wrench on it on the Workbench. Note that, if the Rotor breaks, the Turbine will explode, so
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page10"=you must look at the Rotor from time to time to repair it or it will break your Turbine into pieces! But that usually takes a few Days of ruinning to happen. 100 Durability ^= guaranteed 1.3888 Hours of not breaking.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page11"=So, now for the Maintenance. After a few Hours of running nonstop, your Turbine will get small Problems, which don't prevent it from running, these Problems just decrease Efficiency. Every Problem listed on the Screen does -10% Efficiency.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page12"=To fix these Problems, just go to the Maintenance Hatch and click with the problem corresponding Tool on the Slot to repair. If all six possible runtime Problems happen, the Machine will auto-shutdown no matter what. No Explosion, it's just stopping.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page13"=The Steam Turbine will consume 1600 Liters of Steam per tick and outputs up to 800EU/t at 100% Efficiency. It will also output 10 Liters of Water for these 1600 Liters of Steam, so that closed Boiler cycles are possible.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page14"=If Railcrafts Steam Turbine Rotors are used, they will have 15000 Durability (they loose 2 Durability points each cycle) and the same Efficiency as the regular Steel Rotor, but it can't be repaired without using additional Steel.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page15"=Carbon Rotors are having a 125% Efficiency and very low durability. This means that Steam Turbines using these Carbon Rotors will output a whopping 1000EU/t. You can't repair Carbon Rotors at all, so it's much like 'burning' the Coal. And it's risky.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page16"=A large Gas Turbine is worth about 42 small Gas Turbines, and as the Turbines get much less Efficient, when not having enough Fuel, you should consider making a large Factory for Methane/Steam.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page17"=Input and Output Slots are fully optional, you can place multiple ones of them or even none on the Machine. A Machine without Input couldn't process any Recipes, while a Machine without Output just voids all outputted Items and Liquids.
    S:"Book.Turbine Manual.Page18"=A Turbine needs to have a 3x3 of Air Blocks in front of it, to Function properly, keep that in mind.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Name"=Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page00"=This Book lists all Items, which can be used as special Upgrade for GregTech Machines. As Books are distributed via Worldgen, this Book can be outdated on older Maps (see Version Number on the Title).
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page01"=Reactor Vents of any kind can be used to increase the efficiency of all processing Machines. It only works if the Cover is not obstructed by a solid block. All Objects without Collision Box are not obstructing it (Torches, Buttons, Levers etc.)
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page02"=The Drain can be used to extract Liquid Blocks right in front of it into the Block it is attached to. If it is attached on the top side of the Machine, it is also able to collect Rain Water. It doesnt work pointing downwards for obvious Reasons.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page03"=A Solar Panel Cover does what a normal Solar Panel does, it powers the Machine with Solar Energy, when Sun is shining. This works only if the Panel is attached to the upwards pointing face of the Block, as the Sunlight shines straight downwards.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page04"=Computer Screens have the spcial ability to make only the GUI (or other rightclick action) of a Block accessible. Anything else gets Blocked. It also looks good, if you want to hide your Machines without having a Crowbar in your hand.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page05"=Valves are ideal for transferring Liquids between Machines. They transfer 1 Bucket per tick! The best pipes can only do 80 Millibuckets per tick! If the Machine with the Valve can consume Energy, then it will consume 10EU per Bucket.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page06"=Conveyor Modules can transport Items from one Machine to another. Just attach them on the right side and they will pump out Items at 2EU per Item, if the Machine can consume Energy at all.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page07"=The Liquid, Item, Energy and Progress Meters, are emitting Redstone depending on the amount of their respective measurement inside the attached Machine. The Energy Meter uses the largest of the 3 Capacities, so it also works for Steam/MJ Machines.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page08"=Work Controller Covers are controlling if the Machine is allowed to work or not, depending on injected Redstone. These Covers can be used for almost every Machine, even for the Button Panel, as Key locking Method.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page09"=Overclocker Upgrades, as you know them from Industrial Corp, can be used to speed up Progress in GregTech Machines as well, but more efficiently. Every Overclocker doubles the Speed but also quadruples the required Voltage.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page10"=Transformer Upgrades are used to increase th Voltage which is being handled by a Machine in- and output wise. Also, in case of output, it splits the EU-Packets to four. Higher Voltages such as 2048 and 8192EU/p need an HV-Transformer Upgrade.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page11"=Battery Upgrades of various kinds are increasing the Energy Storage of a Machine. Some Battery Upgrades, like the Lapotronic Energy Orb Upgrade, require a certain Voltage Tier for the Machine to be attached.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page12"=The Pneumatic Generator Upgrade is capable of letting Machines consume Kinetic Energy from Engines, also called MJ (Michael Jacksons). This Upgrade does NOT let you output any of this Energy in form of Electricity!
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page13"=Redstone Energy Cell Upgrades just let you store more kinetic Energy inside your Machine, if a Pneumatic Generator is installed.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page14"=Heating Coils are capable of upgrading the Efficiency of all Furnace alike Devices, including the electric Blast Furnace, when using 4 Coils at once. Note, that you need to install the Coils in a certain order for it to work.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page15"=Steam Engine Upgrades, let your Machines work on Steam directly. 2 Steam = 1 EU. Very useful if you have a Boiler running. If there is no Mod with Steam Engine, then you have to use a Gas Turbine in the Assembling Recipe.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page16"=Steam Tank Upgrades just increase the amount of Steam the Machine can buffer by 64 Buckets (32000 EU).
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page17"=Wireless Transmitter and Receiver are sending/receiving Redstone Signals Wireless and cross dimensional. A little warning: Chunk reloading causes it to not be stable for a second. Screwdriver for Frequency change, by clicking on the 4 Screws.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page18"=Redstone Signalizers apply a constant Redstone Signal to a Side of a Machine. Signal can be changed via Screwdriver.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page19"=Redstone Conductors take the applied Redstone Signal of a Machine and emit it on their Facing.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page20"=Lock Upgrade. This makes a Machine private and unbreakable (except for explosions). Only the one who applied the Upgrade can interact with the Machine.
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page21"=Shutter Cover. This Cover blocks the Inventory/Tank/Redstone Side it is connected to, if a Controller Cover (required!) disables the Work Status of the Block it is connected to. This is very useful in conjunction with Item Pipes and Fluid Pipes ...
    S:"Book.Upgrade Dictionary V4.04p.Page22"= ... the Shutter can also be used to make Pipe Connections One-Way, when being set in the third or fourth Mode to allow only Input or only Output.
    S:"Book.Your Friend the Pipe.Name"=Your Friend the Pipe
    S:"Book.Your Friend the Pipe.Page00"=It's me Mario, and I will explain you how to use Pipes.
    S:"Book.Your Friend the Pipe.Page01"=First we will talk about the various Fluid Pipes. They are simple and easy to understand. You first put a Pump Module onto the Input of the Pipe and set it to import Mode, to let it suck Fluids out of your Tank. Then we lay a Pipe to our Target.
    S:"Book.Your Friend the Pipe.Page02"=When the Target is connected the Fluid will flow into it. The Pipe will take a few seconds to get at full Speed. If you want to measure how much is going through the Pipe, then put an Active Machine Detector on it and place a Redstone Display at it.
    S:"Book.Your Friend the Pipe.Page03"=Now we can go to the Pneumatic Item Pipes. Their use is simple, you put an Item into a Pipe using the Output of a Machine, an importing Conveyor Cover, a Hopper or a Dropper, and the Item will search for the closest valid targets to go in.
    S:"Book.Your Friend the Pipe.Page04"=These Pipes have a Capacity of X Stacks per second, depending on the Material and the Size of the Pipe. When a Pipe tries to route an Item, the capacity of all which are closer to the destination gets used even if it is not in the same direction.
    S:"Book.Your Friend the Pipe.Page05"=This can lead into Pipes being stuck if there is no target, so that they all junk up, so make always sure the Pipes are large enough and that there is always a final target, if you have multiple Inputs.
    S:"Book.Your Friend the Pipe.Page06"=You can put a Conveyor Cover onto the Pipe to suck Items out of an Inventory, when using Import Mode. To measure how much of the Capactiy is being used, use the Active Machine Detector.
