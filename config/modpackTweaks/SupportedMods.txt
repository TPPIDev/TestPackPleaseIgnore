>AdvancedSolarPanels, Advanced Solar Panels<
Advanced Solar Panels is an addon for Industrial Craft 2 (IC2). It only adds a couple of blocks, and they are mostly 
solar panels that deliver high output for a very high initial material cost.~
~
The advanced solar panel generates 8 eu/t in daytime, 1 eu/t at night~
The hybrid solar panel generates 64 eu/t in daytime, 8 eu/t at night~
The ultimate hybrid solar panel generates 512 eu/t in daytime, 64 eu/t at night~
~
The mollecular assembler converts items into better versions of themselves for a high energy cost. For example, 1 Glowstone 
becomes 1 Sunnarium (needed for the ultimate hybrid solar panel) with the input of 9,000,000 EU. This machine can accept 
any amount of energy (i.e. It won't explode).~

>AppliedEnergistics, Applied Energistics<
**<http://ae-mod.info/>**
Applied Energistics is an advanced way to store items as energy in what is known as an ME system. 
It allows for incredibly compact storage as well as item movement throughout your base.
~
To get started, you'll need 2 things - a reliable power source and an ME controller. If you run out of power, your
ME system will shut down and you will be unable to access any of your items.
~
You will also want an ME Access Terminal and an ME Drive. Place all of these down in the world and connect your controller
to the power line. It is worth placing the three ME blocks next to each other so they can transmit energy and talk to
each other.
~~~
Now, you need somewhere to store your stuff. Applied Energistics uses Storage Units in order to store items. Think
of these like hard drives in a computer - your items are stored as information on a disk. Lose the disk - lose the items.
~~~
ME Storage Units come in four sizes - 1k, 4k, 16k and 64k. Each of these units can store 63 unique types of item, but can 
store a different amount of items total. Naturally, a 64k unit can store than a 1k unit, but is more expensive.~
It's up to you to decide which units you would like.
~~~
Place the storage unit in your disk drive, and right click the ME Terminal.
~
Voila!~
You can now store your items as data.~
~
The ME Drive can hold up to 10 storage units all in one block, and so is a very powerful form of item storage.
~~~
Also worth crafting is the ME Crafting Terminal. This functions exactly as the ME Terminal does, but allows you to craft
inside your AE system including Shift-Click support from NEI. Very handy for mass crafting of objects.
~~~
In order to expand your system, you will need some ME Cable. This cable is what transmits all items through the AE network.
There is no limit on length, but beware that each component you add increases the per tick cost of
the system.~
~
Other AE blocks include the ME Interface, Import Bus, Export Bus, Storage Bus and Level Emitter.~
~
The ME Interface can keep a certain amount of items stocked in an inventory, as well as import any items it receives into
the network. It's also accessible with other piping systems such as Itemducts and BuildCraft pipes. It is also used 	
for crafting with machines which is covered later.~
~~~
The Import and Export bus will import items into the network and export them from the network respectively. Each bus
can be upgraded into a Precision or Fuzzy version. A precision bus will only function on precisely the items it's told to.
~~~
For example, if you specify to export a half-broken iron pickaxe, only a half-broken iron pickaxe will be exported not one
with any other durability.~
A fuzzy bus has the capability to do the opposite - it can ignore features such as enchantments
and damage values. Both types of bus can move stacks of items at a time.~
~~~
The Storage bus is a way to give your ME system access to other inventories such as chests or even Forestry multi-farms.
If you right-click the Storage bus, you can specify what items are allowed to be stored and whether the system can
import and export items, only import or only export. The Storage bus can also be upgraded to both a Fuzzy and Precision 
version also.~
~~~
The Level Emitter is a simple device which emits a redstone signal when either levels in the ME system are below a limit
or above a limit.~
This can be used, for example, to only import items when there is less than an amount in your ME system.
~~~
Applied Energistics also adds an extensive Auto-Crafting system.
~
The most basic AE Auto-crafter is a 3x3 multiblock. The edges must all be made of ME Containment Wall, the rest of the
outside filled with ME Heat Vent. 
~
Inside, you can place either an ME Pattern Provider or an ME Crafting CPU. The Pattern 
Provider provides more space for crafting patterns, whereas the Crafting CPU will allow items to be crafted faster.
~
All auto-crafter's need at least one Pattern Provider and one Crafting CPU, except for the 3x3 which just requires a 
Pattern Provider.
~
When the multiblock is built, hook it up with ME Cable. This multiblock will become the place where all the crafting patterns 
are stored for the ME system. To encode patterns, craft an ME Pattern Encoder as well as some ME Blank Patterns.~
~
The Blank Patterns go in the top-right of the Pattern Encoder. Simply place a recipe in the left hand side (it won't
use your items) and hit encode. Take the encoded pattern and place it in the auto-crafter multiblock. Now your AE system
can craft whatever you have taught it! The system is clever enough to follow a crafting tree. For example, if I tell my
system to craft an iron chest it will first automatically craft a chest, then upgrade it into an iron chest.~
~
The ME Interface also has a space for encoded patterns.~
It is this which allows your ME System to craft using other machines.
For example, if I have a furnace filled with coal, I can encode a pattern that says 1 Log = 1 Charcoal.~
When you place a log in the pattern encoder it will automatically set the output to 4 planks, but you can change this simply 
by clicking the output slot with the item you want (charcoal, in this case).~
~
Then, I put my interface on top of the furnace and throw
the pattern in. Now, if I request charcoal from my Access Terminal, we will see wood land in the top slot of the furnace
and get cooked into Charcoal. Simply import this into the network (using an import bus) and the craft is complete. This 
process can allow for very powerful automation processes using all sorts of machines!
~~~
There are a few other blocks and items added by Applied Energistics.~
~
Quantum Network Bridge~
Allows for your ME system to be accessed from another location in the world wirelessly. This is a multiblock that requires
insane amounts of power to sustain. Multiblock is built from a Quantum Link Chamber with 9 Quantum Field Rings around it in
a circle. Create Quantum Entangled Singularities in order to link two tunnels together.
~~~
Quantum Entangled Singularities~
To craft a pair of Quantum Entangled Singularities, throw some Ender Pearl Dust and a Singularity on the ground, and explode
(yes explode) it with some TNT. A pair only requires a single singularity.~
~
Wireless Access Terminal~
As the name suggests, a Wireless Access Terminal. Requires charging either from a Power Relay from AE or another mod
which can charge items.~
~~~
Vibration Catalyst~
Will cook blocks in the world (if possible), i.e. turn cobblestone into smooth stone.~
~
Entropy Accelerator~
Will age or cool any block used on, i.e. turn smooth stone into cobblestone, lava into obsidian etc.~
~~~
Matter Cannon~
A powerful weapon which shoots balls of matter as ammunition at enemies.~
~
ME Chest~
A chest which holds a single ME Storage unit. Does require power. Can be pumped into using Itemducts, BuildCraft pipes etc,
but cannot be pumped out from.~
~~~
ME IO Port~
Can unload a storage cell into the ME Network and can also load data onto a storage cell. Can be used for things such as
having a large drive for your ingots and gems but nothing else.~
~~~
ME Wireless Access Point~
Required in order for the ME Wireless Access Terminal to function. Can be upgraded using range upgrades to allow wireless
access from further away.~
~~~
ME Dark Cable~
When supplied with a redstone signal, acts as regular ME Cable. Without a redstone signal it will disconnect, meaning
any components after the dark cable will lose connection to the ME System.~
~~~
ME Storage Monitor~
When right-clicked with an item will display how many of that item exist in the ME Network. When upgraded by right-clicking
with a Conversion Matrix the Storage Monitor will allow the user to input and extract items by right-clicking.~
~~~
ME Power Relay~
Allows the charging of tools as well as the transport of AE Power to other ME Networks.~
~
ME Transition Plane~
Acts like a Block Breaker and will import the block into the ME Network.~
~~~
P2P Tunnel~
Links two locations in the ME Network together and will pass anything going into one through the other. This allows
for things like transporting fluids and also redstone current through the ME Network. Set what is travelling through the
P2P Network using an ME Bus Memory Card.~
~~~
ME Partition Editor~
Allows a storage unit to be partitioned, allowing it to only store the items specified.~
Can be useful for allowing only metals onto a large drive and not letting any small quantities of items take up all the types.~
Can set a fuzzy or precision format mode.~
~~~
ME Condenser~
Can either trash items it receives, turn them into matter balls which are used in the matter cannon, or singularities 
which are used with the Quantum Link Tunnel.~

>ArsMagica, Ars Magica 2<
Ars Magica 2 is a magical mod with RPG elements. Think mana, spellcasting, levelling up, and fighting fearsome enemies!~
~
It's worth noting that, due to our having had to disable Dryads in TPPI, Nature Guardians must be summoned from their spawn eggs, which we've added a crafting recipe for.
~~~
Other than that, check out the mod's own in-game guide!~
~
To get it, craft an Item Frame and
a normal Book, and get exploring!~
~
You'll have to find liquid Essence; a cyan liquid found in pools in forests and similar biomes.~
~~~
Once you've found an essence pool, place the Item Frame so that it is directly above
the pool of Essence, and place the Book inside the Item Frame.~
~
After some flashes and sparkles, your guidebook will be ready!
~~~
If you find the book confusing, the first things you should craft to unlock the rest of the mod would be the
oculus, inscription table, and crafting alter, respectively.~
~
After doing that, the rest of the mod is yours to explore!~

**Split into silicon, transport, etc?
>Buildcraft, Buildcraft 4<
Buildcraft adds a load of cool ways to automate crafting, processing, and mining.~
~
This mod adds "engines" which are ways to produce MJ. You can also use Thermal Expansion's dynamos,
but you must have an energy conduit between the dynamo and the machine.~
~
There are many different machines, for instance, the quarry. The quarry is an semi-automatic way to mine. You can use
landmarks to set the size of the quarry, but keep in mind 64x64 is the maximum size. Apply a redstone signal to landmarks
to see a red line extending for 64 blocks. The automatic crafting table crafts stuff, automatically! Totally unexpected!~
~
You can also use pipes to transport items, for instance you can make a automated smelter. If you want to learn better,
just start practicing and you'll get the hang of it, or you can watch a mod spotlight.
~

>BuildcraftAddon, Buildcraft Addon<
Buildcraft Addon adds only 3 items.~
~
The stair placer places stairs from your inventory into the world, similiar to the Builder's wand from Extra Utilities, 
except this only works with stairs.~
~
The color selector and color sorter act as an addition to buildcraft transport's item coloring system. It acts as an improved 
lazuli transport pipe in that it will color items to be sorted by the diazuli transport pipe. The color selector allows the user 
to set multiple ghost items in it's GUI (accessed by right clicking) and then select the color the items will be colored to. 
It requires a small amount of power to operate. It is very similar to Red Power 2's sorter.~
The color selector lets you easily color a pipe as well. Right click it (while not pointing at anything) to open the GUI.~

>CarpentersBlocks, Carpenter's Blocks<
Carpenter's Blocks adds wooden frames of vanilla items that can be textured with other blocks to change the appearance.~
~
This mod is mainly used for aesthetic purposes.~
~
There are two tools in addition to the blocks added, the "Carpenter's Hammer" and the "Carpenter's Chisel". These are used 
to alter the carpenter's blocks.
~~~
Basics~
~
Once a Carpenter's block is placed in the world, right-click it with any full-size block (except TileEntities: chests, 
machines, etc.) If the block is compatible, it will take on the appearance of the placed block and also any properties 
of it (fire-resistance, explosion-resistance, etc.) To remove the block used for texturing shift left-click with the 
carpenter's hammer. To alter the appearance further left/right click with the chisel to cycle through additional 
patterns.~
~
In general, left-clicking a carpenter's block with the hammer will re-orient it (turn it left/right) while right-clicking 
will change the block (ex: stairs -> corner stairs -> upside-down stairs -> etc.) 
~~~
Additionally, once a carpenter's block has an overlayed appearance another block can be placed on any side to create a 
cover on the block. These can be altered independently of the main block.~
~
Some items can be used as overlays even though they are not full blocks. These include: seeds, snowballs, vines, string, 
wheat and mushrooms.~
~
All 16 dyes can be used to color a carpenter's blocks. This affects existing overlays, so placing dirt on a carpenter's 
block and then putting purple dye on that will yield purple dirt! Also, the "chisel" mod plays nicely with this mod, so 
many overlays are possible with that in mind.~
~
Since there are only a handful of blocks the following pages will describe the specifics on each block if special features 
exist.
~~~
Carpenter's Block~
~
Left/Right click with the hammer to change the block into a slab. The direction you hit the block changes the orientation 
of the slab.
~~~
Carpenter's Slope~
~
This block is amazing. Remember that right clicking with a hammer will change the block (It has many options, try them out!) 
while left-clicking will re-orient the block.
~~~
Carpenter's Door/Hatch~
~
Right clicking with the hammer will change the appearance while left-clicking will make the door/hatch open to either the right 
or the left (or in the hatch's case the top or the bottom as well). Shift right-clicking will make it behave like either 
an iron door or a wooden door (default). Also, if you have two carpenter's doors side by side, opening/closing one will 
make both open/close!
~~~
Carpenter's Bed~
~
Right/Left clicking with the hammer will change the appearance of the bed-sheets/pillow to a few built in patterns. You can 
still texture the frame of the bed (note it is two blocks so you will need two dye). Shift right-clicking will restore 
the bed's pattern to default.
~~~
Carpenter's Button/Lever/Pressure Plate~
~
Left clicking with the hammer will invert the redstone output. For the pressure plate right clicking with the hammer will 
cycle through triggers so that the pressure plate will only be activated by mobs, animals, players, or everyone.
~~~
Carpenter's Collapsible Block~
~
This block is affected by left clicking any corner of the block with the hammer, as the corner selected will depress by 
one pixel (to a maximum of only one pixel left). Right-clicking raises it by one pixel. Only the top of the block will 
compress this way, trying to make a roof out of these blocks is not a good idea.
~~~
Carpenter's Barrier/Gate~
~
Right clicking with the hammer will rotate between a few textures. Shift right clicking while on the default fence will 
alter the size of the gap in the fence by one pixel.
~~~
Carpenter's Daylight Sensor~
~
Left clicking with a hammer will invert the redstone output. Left clicking will cycle between activating for sunset/sunrise 
or when light levels are low enough for monsters to spawn.
~~~
Carpenter's Ladder~
~
The only thing special about this block is that it can be free-floating (It acts as it's own block and doesn't have to 
be placed on a wall).
~~~
Carpenter's Safe~
~
Similar to the strongbox from Thermal Expansion, this item is linked to the user. Sneak right click with the hammer to  
lock/unlock the safe so others can access it. Right click with the hammer to change automation rules (extraction is 
allowed, not allowed, etc.)~
~
The green/red light indicates if the safe is unlocked/locked respectively. The blue bar indicates how full the safe is. 
Holding a gold ingot and right clicking on the safe will upgrade it to 54 slots (double chest's worth). The only way 
to get the gold back is to break the safe.
~~~
Carpenter's Flower Pot~
~
Right click with some soil (dirt) to place it in the pot and allow plants to be placed in it. Covers are supprted, but so 
are built in patterns (although not both simultaneously). Left/Right click with the hammer to cycle through the patterns. 
Sneak right click with the hammer to reset it to default.~
~
Most plants can be planted in this flower pot, you are no longer limited to flowers and cacti. Sneak left click with the 
hammer to remove the plant and sneak right click to remove the cover.~

>Chisel, Chisel<
Chisel is a mod that adds decorative blocks to minecraft. It modifies existing blocks by use of a chisel to create 
aesthetic blocks similar to the original one.~
~
Chisel adds two blocks to world-generation, marble and limestone. They are purely for looks.~ 
~
To get started first craft a chisel with a stick and an iron ingot (diagonally in a crafting table). There are two ways 
to use it, either in-world or in a crafting GUI.
~~~
To bring up the GUI, right click the chisel while it is in you hotbar. Here you can place the block to modify 
in the center. Try it out with cobblestone, stone, dirt or something else that you have on hand. You will notice that 
blocks appear on the blank slots to the sides. To chisel the block in the center simply left click on the desired block 
that appears on the sides.~ 
~
You can hover over the chiseled blocks to get a more detailed description of each one. Some blocks even have connected 
textures! It should also be noted that if you have 32 blocks in the center and you choose a chiseled block all 32 will be 
transformed! However, you can chisel an already chiseled block and most chisel recipes will let you use this mechanism to 
get the vanilla item back from an existing chiseled block.~
~~~
To chisel a block in-game simply left click the block to be altered. Keep left-clicking on the block to cycle through 
the available options. NOTE: THIS IS CURRENTLY BUGGED, IT WILL CREATE AN INVISIBLE BLOCK. IT IS RECCOMENDED YOU USE THE 
GUI METHOD INSTEAD.~
~
There are also some special items that chisel adds:~
The "Ball O' Moss" creates an Area of Effect "explosion" that changes nearby blocks into mossy versions of them.~
The "Cloud in a bottle" will spawn a cloud when thrown/broken.~ 
~
Finally, there are additional chisel-able blocks that this mod adds. They can be found in NEI.~

>ComputerCraft, ComputerCraft<
<http://computercraft.info/wiki/Getting_Started>
**People looking at this book will mostly be new to CC so a link gives them other resources to learning Lua**
**Even though in-game documentation is better, in this case I think they will use the internet anyway**
**Feel free to document it anyway if you have time/want to though!**

>DamageIndicators, Damge Indicators<
Damage Indicators is a small mod that adds a HUD displaying the health of the entity the player is looking at.~
~
Additionally, you can adjust the settings by pressing "."~

>DartCraft, DartCraft<
To get started in Dartcraft you must first find some power ore. It glows bright yellow and is found deep in the earth (or 
in the Nether). Use it, alongside some ingots to craft a force ingot and a force nugget. Then craft these along with a stick 
in a diagonal to gain a force rod. Right click a bookcase with the force rod to recieve the Book of Mudora, which will have 
information on all things Dartcraft.~

>DimensionalAnchors, Dimensional Anchors<
This mod adds in only one block, the dimensional anchor. This block loads chunks (16x16 squares) for the player in order 
to make automation possible even if the player is absent.~
~
To open the GUI right click the block. The red arrow will decrease the number of loaded chunks while the green arrow will
increase them.~

>EmasherResource, Emashers Resource<
Emasher Resource adds various ores and items to the game. It is meant to be an inclusion to the mod Engineer's Toolbox.
Emasher Resource includes algae, hemp, limestone, red sandstone, and emery ore.~
~
Algae can be harvested by hand and when "planted" in water it will spread to every nearby water source block. It can also
be harvested and burned in a photobioreactor to create hydrogen to be burned as an energy source.~
~
Hemp can be used for armor, string, paper, cactus green, and hemp seeds. The seeds can be crafted into hemp seed oil
which can be used as a fuel.~
~
Limestone can be used to make quicklime which is used in Engineer's Toolbox's ore processing.~
~
Emery ore is simply used to make the grinder (Engineer's Toolbox). It is about as rare as diamonds.~
~
Red Sandstone is aesthetic?~

>EnderIO, EnderIO<
Ender IO adds compact liquid conduits, energy conduits and redstone conduits, power generation, machinery, remote area 
access, and more. This mod is similar to Thermal Expansion; it supports RF and MJ.~
~~~
Machines~
~
All Machines consume power (MJ, the bar on the left side of the GUI) and can be upgraded with capacitors to increase their 
energy storage (and their speed/energy consumption)~
~
SAG Mill~
This item acts as a pulverizer/macerator, grinding ores into dusts to increase output.~
~
Alloy Smelter~
This item acts as both a normal smelter (smelting 3 items at once) as well as an alloy smelter to make special alloys for 
Ender IO.~
~
Painting Machine~
This item can texture either fused quartz frames or conduit facade with an overlaying block's texture. Place the block with 
the desired texture in the left hand slot and the frame/facade in the right hand slot.
~~~
Energy and Conduits~
~
Generators~
~
Stirling Generator~
Your basic generator, burning items such as coal to create power. 10 RF/t.~
~
Photovoltaic Cell~
A solar panel. It produces 10 RF/t in sunlight.~
~~~
Power Storage/Information~
~
Power Monitor~
This item allows you to monitor the power of all items connected to your Ender IO power grid and it's peripherals (ex: TE machines). 
This block has two tabs. One displays information about the network while the other tab is for restone engine control.~
~
Capacitor Bank~
This block acts as a scalable power storage option (it can become a multi-block). Each block added to the structure will 
add it's power storage and at 2, 4, and 8 blocks the power output flow rate will increase.
~~~
Conduits~
~
Multiple Ender IO conduits can exist in the same blocks, allowing for some very compact setups. In 
addition, they can be covered with a painted conduit facade to cover them up. Holding a conduit or a Yeta Wrench will 
render the conduit facades invisible, allowing you to easily find your conduits.~
~
The liquid conduit transfers fluids. The rate of transfer is dependent on the fluid.~
The redstone conduit transmits a redstone signal. A lever/button can be attached to it or a conduit switch can be used. 
To activate the conduit switch right click on one of the small squares on the end of the conduit.~
The energy conduits transfer energy at varying capacities.~
The item conduits tranfer items; the empowered conduit has more filtering options.~
~
Both the item and liquid conduits have a GUI which can be accessed by right clicking the square that appears when the conduit 
connects to an inventory. This can be used to set insert/extraction modes. ALternatively a yeta wrench can be used to control 
the output mode without entering the GUI.
~~~
The Dimensional Transceiver~
~
This item acts as a tesseract, with the ability to transfer liquids, items, and power across dimensions through a single 
block (to another transceiver on the same frequency). It has frequency settings in the GUI and will automatically output 
energy/items to adjacent conduits/inventories.
~~~
Tools~
~
Power Probe~
This item will give information about a machine or even a network when right clicked on a machine. It is similar to a 
portable power monitor.~
~
Yeta Wrench~
This item acts as a wrench, meaning it can pick up machines (except IC2 machines) by shift right clicking the machine. 
It also can see through facades, and only certain facades, the filter is indicated in the bottom left hand corner of the 
screen and can be altered by shift right clicking while not aiming at a machine.~
~~~
Other~
~
Reservoir~
This item, when built in a 2x2x1 square, will act as an infinite water source, much like in vanilla minecraft. The reservoir 
can also auto-eject if right clicked with a wrench.~
~
Powered Light~
This item will emit light but will require .1 MJ/t (or 1 RF/t) to operate. It must be turned on with a redstone signal.~
~
Fused Quartz~
This item acts as aesthetic glass with connected textures. The frame can also be painted by right clicking with a painted 
fuzed quartz frame.~

>EnderProspecting, Ender Prospecting<
Ender Prospecting adds a couple items to assist with manual mining. They are the Eye of Prospecting, the Talisman  
of Prospecting, and the Totem of Prospecting.~
~
The Eye of Prospecting can be crafted alongside any ore and will then be "tuned" to this ore. The next time you right 
click the eye it will fly away from you, much like an Eye of Ender, except it will fly toward the tuned ore. It will 
then break, this item is one-time-use.~
~
The (Base) Talisman of Prospecting can be crafted with 5 tuned eyes to yield a tuned Talisman. It acts similarly to the 
Eye, except it is reusable and has a smaller range. Every time the Talisman is right clicked it will indicate a direction 
that the tuned or is.~
~
The Totem of Prospecting can be crafted/tuned similarly to the Talisman. It doesn't require being right clicked, but it 
has an even smaller range and doesn't indicate a direction, only that the ore is in close proximity.~

>EnderStorage, Ender Storage<
Ender Storage adds the Ender chest, the ender tank and the ender pouch. Each chest/pouch and tank will link to each other
assuming they are on the same "frequency" (indicated by the wool pads on top). The pads can be colored with each dye,
either in-game by clicking on the pads with a dye in hand, or by crafting the item below the dye frequency in a crafting
table.~
~
Ender pouches are merely a portable form of ender chests and can be linked to ender chests if they share the same frequency. 
If you lose an ender item with item(s)/liquid(s) stored in it, they will remain stored in the chest with the frequency
they were stored in.~
~
If you place a diamond in the latch of an ender chest it will become linked to the player that placed the placed the 
diamond, meaning that each player in a SMP server can have access to all 4096 frequencies.~

Flat signs alters existing signs in Minecraft by allowing flat versions of signs to be placed on the floor or the ceiling 
by shift right clicking a sign on the floor/ceiling.~
~
It also allows for signs to be edited by using a sponge or the more durable sponge wipe. To craft a sponge just throw yellow 
wool into water or on the ground while it is raining.~

>Gendustry, Gendustry<
Gendustry is a mod that acts as an add-on for Forestry's bee and tree (and butterfly) breeding systems. It adds a number 
of blocks that will be discussed on the following page(s).~
~
Each block can accept EU, MJ, or RF. All blocks can input/output from any side.
~~~
The Industrial Apiary~
~
This block requires 2 MJ/t to operate, has 4 slots for upgrades (but doesn't support frames), and also doesn't have the 
90% production reduction of normal apiaries.~
~
The gauge on the left is for power storage. The left slots are for a Queen/Princess and Drones, the middle 4 slots are for 
upgrades, and the right 9 slots are for products and offspring.~
~
You can hover over the status icon (in the top right) to see more information about the block.~
~
Bees can be inserted and products can be extracted from any side. Upgrades cannot be automated, but the automation upgrade 
will automatically move offspring back into the left slot to continue breeding~
~
The upgrades for gendustry are described by hovering over them in NEI.
~~~
The Mutagen Producer~
~
This item will convert solid items into Mutagen (a liquid used to mutate bees/trees in the Mutatron).~
~
Items can be inserted into any side, and liquids will be automatically ejected to any adjacent pipe or tank.~
~
The items that are used as valid fuel sources are, in decreasing order of effectiveness, uranium, glowstone, and then 
redstone. Click on the recipes bar in the machine to see the detailed values for each item (power needed, mutagen produced).
~~~
The Mutatron/Advanced Mutatron~
~
The Muatron consumes Mutagen to force mutations. It requires 1 bucket of mutagen (1000mb), 20,000 MJ per operation, and 
a labware.~
~
The gauges on the left are for internal power and mutagen storage. For bees, princesses go in the top slot and 
drones go in the bottom slot. For trees, saplings go in the top slot and pollen goes in the bottom slot. If a bee is 
being mutated, the resulting bee will be a pure-bred bee. Ignoble bees have a 10% chance of not surviving the process.~
~
Bees and labware can be inserted from any side and results can be extracted from any side.~
~
The advanced mutatron allows a selection of mutation if there are multiple possible results. It can work twice as fast if 
the energy supply is adequate.
~~~
The Genetic Sampler/Imprinter~
~
Takes genetic samples from Bees, Trees, or even Butterflies, randomly selecting one genetic trait from the input and killing 
the sampled creature in the process. It can also convert Extra-Bees serums into gendustry samples~
~
It consumes labware (top right) and blank samples (top left), as well as 20,000 MJ per operation.~
~
To use the samples, craft them with a template (shapeless receipe, any number of samples can be added at once). Every chromosome 
(ex: fertility, species, etc.) can only be added once to a template, any additions will overwrite previous samples. All 
samples must belong to the same species (ex: no using tree species on a bee). Unneeded templates/samples can be cleaned 
by applying heat (ex: putting them in a furnace).~
~
The implanter replaces the traits of the input bee with the traits on the template (top left slot).~
~
It uses 80,000 MJ and a labware (top right slot) per operation. The template will not be consumed (or altered). Ignoble bees 
have a 10% chance to not survive the process.~
~
The template can be removed from any side, but only when no imprinting is ongoing and the input slot is empty.
~~~
The Industrial Grafter~
~
Acts as a powered Forestry grafter, that is very fast but also comsumes a lot of power.~
~
It can be charged in any machine that will charge MJ, RF, or tier 2 or higher EU (eg. capacitor bank, energetic infuser,
MFE).~

>GregTech, GregTech<
<gregtechcommunitywiki.wikispaces.com>
**GregTech is far, far too complex for Minecraft's Written Book format.**
**I think the only way to provide support for that mod is either a wiki link**
**Or a book format resembling Thaumcraft's or RotaryCraft's.**

>GraviSuite, Gravitation Suite<
Gravitation Suite (Gravi Suite) is an addon for IC2 which adds very expensive, but powerful, EU-powered items. It adds both 
tools and armor.
~~~
Armor~
~
The Gravi-Chest Plate~
~
This item contains all of the functionality of the quantum chest plate as well as additional fucntions. It 
provides creative mode flight and the ability to charge any EU items in your inventory. To toggle on/off flight, press 'f'. 
To toggle on/off boost mode press 'ctrl'. This item also has 'hover mode'. This will allow you to fly much faster at an increased energy cost. The Gravi 
Chest Plate can be charged in a MFSU or higher tier EU storage.~
~
Advanced Electric Jetpack~
~
This item combines the electric jetpack and the advanced lappack. This item also has boost mode, hover mode, and, 
obviously, flight, as well as 1,000,00 EU energy storage.~
~
The Ultimate Solar Helmet~
~
This combines the Ultimate Hybrid Solar Panel from Advanced Solar Panels with the quantum helmet to charge your armor at 512 EU/t 
while still retaining the functionality of the quantum helmet.~
~
The Ultimate lappack~
~
This item holds 10,000,000 EU.
~~~
Tools~
~
The tools can all be charged in a MFE or higher.~
~
The Vajra~
~
This item can break any block (including bedrock) in one hit, even when flying or swimming, but it costs a very, very large 
amount of EU per block broken~
~
Advanced Drill~
Thsi drill is 35% faster than the diamond drill but it consumes significantly more power.~
~
Advanced Chainsaw~
This chainsaw has a higher damage (12) than the normal chainsaw and it also operates 35% faster.~

>HardcoreEnderExpansion, Hardcore Ender Expansion<
<http://hardcore-ender-expansion.wikia.com/wiki/Home>

>ImmibisMicroblocks, Immibis Microblocks<
Immibis Microblocks (along with Forge Multipart) creates the ability to cut down blocks into parts. This allows multiple 
parts of blocks to exist in the same 1-block space, which wouldn't otherwise be possible. For example, torches are now 
multiparts and so 2 of them can exist on the same intersection of a two walls. As another example, Thermal Expansion 
pipes/conduits are multiparts, so a cover can be placed on them to "hide" the wiring while still retaining the 
aesthetics of your house.~
~
To create multiparts simply craft a saw and then follow the NEI instructions to creaft your desired shape/size!~
~
Note: A large number of microblocks may cause lag. As long as you don't go beserk with them you should be fine though.~

**>IndustrialCraft, IndustrialCraft (Experimental)<**
**Someone in the thread (Burn447) mentioned he was working on this**

>Infinibows, Infinibows<
Infinibows is a small mod that just removes the need to have an arrow in your inventory to shoot a bow with the infinity 
enchant.~

>IronChests, Iron Chests<
Storage...you always need more of it!~
This mod adds chests that are much larger than your regular double chest.~
There are copper, iron, gold, silver, diamond, obsidian, and crystal chests.~
To make an iron chest for example, surround a wooden chest with iron ingots.~
Check NEI for the higher recipies, as some aren't all like the first example.~
Want to upgrade an existing chest without having to break it? See the next page.~
~~~
Upgrading:~
~
Make a chest upgrade, and right click a single or couble chest to use it!~
If you upgrade a double chest it will split the chest in half, one side getting the upgrade.~
Different chests have different properties, see the next page for that info.~
~~~
Chest Types:~
~
Copper: 45 slots~
Iron: 54 slots~
Silver: 72 slots~
Gold: 81 slots~
Diamond: 108 slots~
Crystal: 108 slots, you can see the contents inside!~
Obsidian: 108 slots, completely blast-proof!~
~~~
That's all!:~
~
Hope you enjoyed this guide, and if you need anything added please let us know!~
~

>JABBA, JABBA<
So...Barrels:~
This mod adds barrels, just like factorization! The differences are few, but useful.~
First off, there are many shortcuts to interact with barrels.~
~~~
Shortcuts:~
Right-click to put a stack in a barrel.~
Left-click to drop a stack from a barrel.~
Shift+Left-click to drop one item from a barrel.~
Double right-click to put all the corresponding items from your inventory into the barrel.~
Shift+Right-click with an empty hand to lock the barrel.~
Shift+Right-click with an upgrade will apply the upgrade to the barrel.~
~~~
Dollies:~
~
Craft a dolly to move barrels without breaking them!~
But the Dolly isn't just for JABBA, you can moce chests, Iron Chests, BC Tahnks, TE Machines, IC2 machines, and more!~
Each time you set an item down with the dolly, it will try to orient the machine/chest to face you.~
~~~
Ore conversion:~
~
Have four kinds of copper, making efficient storage impossible? Look no further than JABBA.~
Simply put one kind of dust/ingot in a JABBA barrel, and any further input of the same ore-
dictionaried item will convert it!~
This works with automation also. I can hear the choir singing...~
~~~
Lock, Stock, and Barrel:~
~
In order to keep the item template in a barrel, just shift-right click!~
A lock icon will appear, and the barrel will never lose the template, even if you remove
all stacks from it.~
This ensures that you can keep empty locked barrels in your factory, even if you run out of items in
the system.~
~~~
That's all!:~
~
Hope you enjoyed this guide, and if you need anything added please let us know!~

>LogisticsPipes, Logistics Pipes<
<http://rs485.thezorro266.com/wiki/Main_Page>

>MagicalCrops, Magical Crops<
If you are the kind of player that just hates mining, and would rather farm your diamonds,
Magical Crops is the mod for you!~
This mod adds ways to grow many different resources like coal, redstone, experience, and more!~
Don't you worry though, it's not as easy as you think!
~~~
Getting Started:~
~
During your mining adventures you might come across Essence Ore. Mine this with iron or better to get essence dust!~
You can see what this will be used for in NEI, and it is a very useful material to have.~
While de-grassing the terrain you might get essence seeds as a drop. Lucky you, as this is a rare chance.~
This plant will grow the same essence you get from mining the Essence Ore.~
Head to the next page to learn about how Infusion Stones!~
~~~
Magical Stones:~
~
If you search NEI you'll see there are seeds for every vanilla resource (and modded resources if supported)~
In order to craft the resource seeds you will need infusion stones.~
There are five strengths of stones: Weak, Regular, Strong, Extreme, and Master.~
Each can help you craft resources based on what tier they are in.~
For example, a weak infusion stone cannot craft diamonds.~
Check NEI for the recipies using the infusion stones to craft resources!~
~~~
The Essentials (get it)~
~
Once you have a weak infusion stone and some essence dust, you can craft Weak Essence!~
This, along with the other strengths of essence, is used to craft the seeds for resource crops.~
Take coal seeds for example, they require 4 Coal, 4 Weak Essence, and one seed.~
Harvesting a coal crop will drop Coal essence and 1-2 coal seeds for replanting!~
The mod makes things a bit more challenging, as you'll see on the next page:~
~~~
Stepping Things Up:~
~
Weak Essence may be easy to get, but to make one piece of Regular Essence, you need a
Regular Infusion stone and four weak essence!~
This makes sure you can't start growing diamonds in a matter of minutes (or even hours).~
Crops do grow slowly, and you cannot use bonemeal, but there are other ways ;]~
~
You didn't think the mod stopped at merely growing diamonds did you?~
~~~
Food!~
~
That's right, there's even food added to the game! You'll find all sorts of seeds like
sweetcorn, chilis, grapes, cucumbers, and more by breaking grass!~
This diversifies your kitchen, but there's more!~
You also can make four new stews from pork, mutton, beef, and chicken.~
Is calamari your fancy? How about some nice bouled eggs? Dried flesh? Magical Crops has you covered.~
I didn't even mention juice or super bread...~
~~~
Juiced Up!~
~
By infusing bread with various essences, you get super bread! Chomp down on a piece to find out what
magical abilities you'll gain.~
Besides bread, you can use a Juicer to make, well, juice!~
Each bottle of juice restores 3 hunger except for Berry Blast, which is 4.~
The mod doesn't stop at food, for those that like options while building, see the next page!~
~~~
Infused Blocks:~
~
Smack obsidian essence with blocks and you give them fire and explosion resistance!~
You can do this to clay, wool, and even wood planks.~
House too dark, and don't want to put up ugly torches? Make Light-infused blocks!~
These blocks emit a light level of 14 (glowstone), and you can infuse stone bricks,
planks, and regular stone types.~
Tinting many kinds of blocks is also possible. Want to have a base made of diamond tinted stone bricks? Done.~
~~~
And Finally:~
The mod may seem overpowered, but don't worry, the TPPI devs have nerfed it quite a bit.~
~
Hope you enjoyed this guide, and if you need anything added please let us know!~
~

>MagicBees, Magic Bees<
Magic Bees is an addon for the Forestry bee-breeding system that also utilizes Thaumcraft. As a result, all of the information 
for this mod can be found under the Magic Bees tab in the Thaumonomicon. If you are confused about bees in general, please 
consult the "Forestry-Bees" book.~

>Mekanism, Mekanism<
<http://mekanism.wikispaces.com/>

>MFFS, Modular Force Field System<
Modular Force Field System, or MFFS for short, is a mod that allows for the creation of a wide array of force fields.~
The mod uses it's own form of power, Fortron a telepathic liquid, however can be hooked up to other energy systems from Buildcraft and IndustrialCraft~
~~~
Most of the blocks are made up of Focus Matrixes so it won't be until you have a good source of diamonds, redstone and steel.~
Be sure to check NEI for all the recipes.~
~~~
To get started, you'll need to craft a Coercion Deriver and hook it up to a source of power.~
Be sure to give it an active redstone signal. Once powered the Coercion Deriver will turn from red to blue and begin converting energy into Fortron.~
~~~
The Coercion Deriver will now have to be hooked up the other MFFS machines. To do this create a Frequency Card.~
With this card shift right click, while facing nothing and it will generate a unique frequency ID.~
This can now be used to set your MFFS frequencies to match.~
Once a machine is connected and receiving power, from your Coercion Deriver, you'll see a light blue beam between them.~
~~~
Our next goal is to store this newly converted energy.~
The Fortron Capacitor serves as an energy storage for MFFS machines. Designed to store Fortron energy generated by the Coercion Derivers.~
If you wish to build this, place it nearby the Coercion Derivers, turn it on and set it's frequency.~
~~~
You've built up some Fortron, good - as it's time to put together the Force Field Projector.~
The Force Field Projector is the core of the mod. It uses our generated Fortron energy and projects force fields of various shapes and sizes.~
To achieve this, craft one of the following projector mode items:~
Cube Mode~
Custom Mode~
Pyramid Mode~
Sphere Mode~
Tube Mode~
~
Place this newly crafted item into the slot surrounded by outwardly facing arrows.~
Next, craft some Scale Modules and place them into the Matrix slots on the left side of the GUI screen.~
Each of these will increase the radius of the projection by a block.~
Set it to the correct frequency and turn it on. A forcefield of your defined shape and size will start to build.~
Be sure to note that these are solid blocks.~
~~~
Going forward you can start to look at the other modules for your projector, including the Speed Module and Capacity Module.~
Perhaps you want to give your forcefields methods of security, take a look at Interdiction Matrix or Biometrix Identifier.~
Want more advance forcefields, investigate the usage of the Force Manipulator.~
Alot of these blocks and more can be found on the MFFS wiki.~

>MFR, MineFactory Reloaded<
MineFactory Reloaded is a vast mod, comprising many useful 
machines and automation devices.  From conveyor belts to tree farms, 
there is something in MFR for everybody.~
~
To get started, most of the MFR machines require rubber.  Rubber trees are 
generated throughout the landscape.  Break the wood to acquire the flexible 
material, then smelt it into rubber bars, and then again into raw plastic.  
This plastic can then be crafted into sheets of plastic, which are the foundation 
for most of the machines.

>Morph, Morph<
Morph is a mod that allows you to take on the characteristics (shape/size/ability(s)) of any creature you kill (except 
bosses, although that is a config option).~
~
All abilities are disabled, and morphs are purely cosmetic. Besides, being 1 block tall, of course.~
~
To access your morphs, press "[" or "]", and then scroll down. Press "Enter" to select your morph.~
~
Morph also has a wheel for your favorite morphs, accessed by pressing "~"/"`". To add a morph to your favorites, press 
the same key, "~", while selecting the desired morph in the menu.~

>Natura, Natura<
Natura adds world-generation, mainly in the form of some additional trees and some new blocks.~ 
~
The most notable are the berry bushes. These are found in the wild and will grow up and out and will produce berries 
that can be harvested by right clicking on the bush. The berries don't fill your hunger very much, but they will 
increase your saturation (a hidden value that determines when you will become hungry again), and you can even eat the 
berries when full to max out your saturation.~
~
This mod also adds in generation to the Nether, allowing you to make bows that have a higher durability than vanilla ones.~
~
This mod also adds in cotton plants. These will grow until white balls appear on the plant, then can be harvested and will 
revert to an earlier stage of growth rather than having to be replanted.~
Finally, wheat/barley (wild form of wheat) can be crafted shapelessly into flour, which can then be smelted into bread.~

>NEI, Not Enough Items<
Not Enough Items (or NEI for short) adds the menu you see on your screen when opening your (or any) inventory. It is primarilly 
used to show how to craft items and what items are used for. It can be disabled/hidden by pressing "o".~
~
To use NEI, hover over an item in the menu and press "r" for recipe to bring up how to make that item or press "u" for 
use or what that item is used for. You will notice you also have a search bar on the bottom slot of your screen. This 
can be used to limit the results shown on the right hand side tab. Double clicking the search bar will highlight results 
that match whatever is typed into the search bar. Double clicking it agin will reset it.~
~
The left hand side of your screen contains saves, you can store your inventory in this save, and then loading it will 
replace your inventory with the saved one (if cheat mode is enabled). In the top left you will see many options. Most 
are self-explanatory, but the one you will likely use the most is next to the magnet; it will change your game mode.~
~~~
Options/NEI Modes~
~
At the bottom left you will see "options". Clicking on that will bring you to another menu screen. The most useful one 
is the topmost one, "Inventory". There you can change between "Recipe Mode", "Cheat Mode", and "Utility Mode". Utility 
mode will let you use the utilities in-game. Recipe mode will, when you left click an item on the main NEI panel, do the 
same thing as pressing "r", while right clicking will do the same thing as pressing "u". Cheat mode will allow you to 
obtain any number of items from the main NEI panel by clicking on them. Left clicking will give you 64 (a stack) of items, 
while right clicking will give you one of the selected item. While in cheat mode you can drag items to the right hand 
panel to delete them.
~~~
Tips/Tricks~
~
Type in "@modnamehere" to see all the items from a specific mod.~
You can right click the search bar to instantly clear it!!
In any crafting inventory, left clicking on the little '?' will overlay ghost images on the crafting grid to make it easy 
to see what components go where. Shift left clicking will, if you have the items in your inventory, automatically put them 
in the crafting grid in the correct location(s).~

>NetherOres, Nether Ores<
Nether ores adds ore generation to the Nether. These ores have a higher yield than their overworld counterparts, but 
they also have a propesity to explode, so caution is necessary.~

>NotEnoughKeys, Not Enough Keys<
This mod adds a key-binding menu so it is more simple to navigate through the mess of conflicting keybinds. To access it 
simply go into options -> controls and then modify as you see fit.~

>NuclearControl, Nuclear Control<
<http://forum.industrial-craft.net/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=5915>

>ObsidiPlates, Obsidian Pressure Plates<
This mod adds a few pressure plates to the game.~
~
Obsidian Pressure Plates~ 
Will only give off a redstone signal if a player is standing on them.~ 
~
Mossy Cobblestone Pressure Plates~ 
Will only give off a signal if a NPC (ex: a villager) is standing on them.~ 
~
Both pressure plates can be silent (no clicking sound) and shrouded (see-through). It should be noted that to create a 
silent and shrouded pressure plate you must apply silent first and then shrouded.~

>OpenBlocks, OpenBlocks<
<http://openmods.info/>

>OpenPeripheral, OpenPeripheral<
Open peripheral is an addon for ComputerCraft. It allows you to wrap a variety of items as peripherals.~ 
~
To see if an item is a valid peripheral (and to get the commands for it) do the following:~ 
"side" is the side of the computer that the item to be wrapped as a peripheral is located (ex: "left", "top", etc). 
The side should be enclosed in quotation marks.~ 
p = peripheral.wrap("side")~ 
print (p.listMethods())~ 
~
There are also some items that this mod adds, explained in the following page(s).
~~~
PIM~
This item allows you to access a player's inventory (if he/she) is standing on it.~
~
Sensor~
This item allows you to scan the nearby area for information. Use listMethods() for more information.~
~
Peripheral Proxy~
This item allows you to wrap certain items as peripherals through a modem. Make sure the arrows are facing the item to be 
wrapped and the modem is on and is located on the back of the proxy.~
~
Ticket Machine~
This item can be used to print out tickets for Railcraft.~
~
Terminal Glasses/Termianl Glasses Bridge~
The glasses can be worn by a player and the information passed to the bridge will appear on the player's HUD.~
~
Duck Antenna~
No idea :P They must have... It makes some people QUACK UP when they read the name... Ha! :D~

>PluginsForForestry, Plugins for Forestry<
Plugins for forestry adds compatability between forestry and other mods. It adds the ability to use sugar and cactus in 
a coke oven (railcraft) to make sugar/coal charcoal/coke for power.~

>PortalGun, Portal Gun<
**<http://ichun.us/w/index.php?title=Portal_Gun>**
The Portal Gun mod allows players to travel between two portals in a similar way to the Portal video games.~
~
The basic Portal gun can create two portals with left and right click. Walk through one portal and arrive at the other. 
This works not just for players but items as well!~
~
The Portal gun can also pick up certain blocks such as chests and move them around. ~
This is done by aiming at the block 
you would like to move and holding G (default). When the block is where you want it, release G and it will be placed back down. ~
~~~
The Portal gun can be upgraded into four different versions: ~
Atlas' Portal Gun and P-Body's Portal Gun both act the same as the basic Portal gun except the Portal's they create
are different colours. ~
This means that the Portals from the Atlas' and P-Body guns are not linked to those of the default portal.~
~
They will be linked, however, to all other Atlas' and P-Body gun portals respectively.~
~~~
The Bacon Gun and Portal Gun gives each player a unique colour of portal, and so your portals won't get mixed up with anyone 
else's on a server.~
~~~
Portal Gun also adds Portal Spawners which can create portals of whatever colour you choose when 
supplied with a redstone signal. The portal remains open until the redstone signal is lost.~
~~~
Also added are Portal Gun Pedestals. These can hold a Portal Gun and will fire a portal when supplied with a redstone signal. 
You can retrieve a Portal Gun which has been placed on a Pedestal just by right-clicking.~

>Thaumcraft, Thaumcraft 4<
Thaumcraft is a magical mod that requires you to "research" its items before you can craft them.~
~
There's all kinds of magical swag that you can build and play with, but it's probably best for you to 
learn about it on your own.~
~
To get started, craft a iron capped wooden wand, 
place a bookshelf on the ground, and right-click your wand on it.~
~
It should transform into a Thaumonomicon; the true guidebook for Thaumcraft!~
~
The only thing to know that is not documented in the book is that some research will be impossible, you can throw it 
away and restart with newly generated research notes at any time though.~
 
>ThaumicTinkerer, Thaumic Tinkerer<
Thaumic Tinkerer is an addon to Thaumcraft (a magical mod). All the information is documented in the Thaumonomicon.~
 
>ThaumicTinkererKami, Thaumic Tinkerer Kami<
Thaumic Tinkerer Kami (God) is an optional portion of the mod that is enabled by default.~
~
It includes many end game items that can only be viewed in the Thaumonomicon after all 
research in normal Thaumcraft, Electro-Magic Tools, and Thaumic Tinkerer are completed.~
 
>ThermalExpansion, Thermal Expansion 3<
Thermal Expansion (TE) is a "technology" mod that adds a power system called Redstone Flux (RF). 
It has itemducts, fluiducts, and energy conduits for transporting items, liquids, and RF power 
respectively, as well as a bunch of useful blocks for ore processing, automatic crafting, storage, and more.~
~
You can start generating RF power using the mod's dynamos and some energy conduits, with leadstone conduits being the 
lowest tier. All TE conduits convert RF to MJ (Buildcraft energy) if needed. 
You can rotate and pick up machines by right clicking and shift right clicking with a Crescent Hammer, 
the mod's version of a wrench.~
~~~
All machines in the mod have their own configuration settings in their GUIs.~
~
The redstone behavior tab lets you choose how the machine will respond to redstone.~
The configuration tab lets you choose where the machine will input and output its products, 
be that energy, liquids, or power, on a per block face basis.~
~
Blue indicates an input on a given face, while orange indicates an output.~
There are other colors used situationally depending on the machine. 
For these, it's best to select that color in the configuration menu, then look 
back at the main GUI of the machine.~
The slot in the machine associated with that color will 
be highlighted in that color. This should help indicate what that color's purpose is 
for that particular machine.
~

>TinkersConstruct, Tinkers' Construct<
Tinkers' Construct is a mod that lets you build custom tools out of 
various materials, each with their own special properties.~
~
To get started with the basics, check out the book "Materials And You" that 
you should have spawned with.
~

>TinkersMechworks, Tinkers' Mechworks<
Tinker's Mechworks is an addon for Tinkers' Construct. It adds drawbridges, an igniter, and signal busses/terminals, all 
of which are described on the following pages.
~~~
Drawbridge~
~
The drawbridge can extend and retract 15 blocks in the direction it is facing. It is activated with a redstone signal. 
The left slot is for a block that "disguises" the drawbridge to make it look like the block in the left slot. 
The right slot is for the blocks that are to be extended/retracted.~ 
~
The extended drawbridge can extend up to 64 blocks.~
~
The advanced drawbridge can extend more than one type of block, as each block is placed in the GUI.
~~~
Igniter~
~
The igniter will light the block in front of it on fire when given a redstoen signal and will extinguish the flame when 
the resdtone signal is turned off.
~~~
Signal Bus/Terminal/Wire~
~
These items function as redstone that can travel through blocks. To get started, craft a spool of wire by surrounding a 
stone tool rod with 8 lengths of wire in a crafting table. The spool of wire can be crafted with additional lengths of wire 
(up to 8 at a time maximum) to give the length of wire more length. The damage bar underneath the length of wire visually 
represents how much wire is left.~
~
The spool of wire (truly the wire itself) is used to connect signal terminals to signal busses and back to signal terminals. 
To connect the two right click on the top red part of the terminal with the spool of wire and then right click on the 
signal bus with the same spool of wire. If you have enough wire and the terminal and the bus are 15 or less blocks away 
you should see a small red line connecting the two. If you move your cursor away from the spool of wire on your hotbar the 
red line will dissapear visually. Now you can connect the second terminal to the bus, using the length of wire, to 
complete the circuit.
~~~
Signal Bus/Terminal/Wire (continued)~
~
A redstone signal can be applied to the terminal (or the block the terminal is placed upon) and the redstone signal will 
be transmitted to the terminal at the end of the wire. A terminal can connect to multiple busses but busses cannot connect 
to other busses.~
~
Right clicking the white part of a signal terminal with an open hand will change the terminal's color. Only terminals of 
the same color will send redstone signals.~

>TPPITweaks, TPPI Tweaks<
TPPITweaks is the mod made especially for the TPPI Modpack, 
which is the representative modpack for /r/feedthebeast.~
~
It contains many tweaks for mods to better improve balance, 
and some helpful objects to better guide the player in the modpack.~
~

>Translocators, Translocators<
The Translocators mod adds 2 items to the game, the translocators themselves and a crafting grid.~
~
Translocators allow for the movement of items through a 1-block space. More info is on the following page.~
~
The crafting grid can be accessed by pressing 'c' (configurable in keybinds) and will bring up a grid to place items in. 
Right click to place/remove items and press 'c' again on the grid to craft the item(s).
~~~
Translocators can be placed on the side of an inventory/machine/tank. There are both item and liquid translocators.~
~
Right clicking on the protruding center of the translocator with an open hand will depress the center. Items/liquids will 
always flow from the translocator with a protruding center to the translocator(s) with an inset center.~
~
Right clicking on the plate of the item translocator brings up a configurable filter.
~~~
Adding a diamond nugget (a diamond in a crafting table gives 9) puts a translocator in regulate mode. 
In this mode it will maintain a certain amount of items set in the filter in the inventory it’s attached to. 
On an inserting face, it will only accept items to fill the inventory to the matching filter. 
On an ejecting face, it will eject any items that don’t match the filter.~
~
Adding glowstone to the plate makes it transfer stacks at a time. 
Adding redstone lets you toggle input/output with a redstone signal.~
~
Adding an iron ingot makes the translocator emit redstone signals to the attached inventory on certain conditions. 
On an inserting face, it will emit if there is no room for any item that matches the filter. 
On an ejecting face, it will emit if there is no place where any item can be put that matches the filter.~
~
Shift-Right clicking on the plate will strip and drop all upgrades placed on the translocator.
~~~
Translocators will follow these rules:~
~
Items/liquids will always travel to non-redstone outputs if they can.~ 
Items/Liquids will be evenly split between available outputs. Items will be taken from the slot with the largest quantity.~

>Waila, Waila<
WAILA stands for "What Am I Looking At?" It introduces a HUD tooltip which indicates what block you are looking at. 
It tells you the block name and what mod it is from.~
~
By adding the tooltip for the mod name in NEI you can now search "railcraft" instead of "@railcraft" to get the items 
added by railcraft.~
~
It also adds some tooltip values for various items (ex: shows how much heat coal can produce in a firebox)~
~
There are also, by default, some (numpad) keybinds that can be used
as well:~ 
1: Toggles on and off the HUD~
2: Toggles on and off showinq liquids~
3: Shows the uses for the item slected (through NEI)~
4: Shows how the item selected can be used (through NEI)~

>Witchery, Witchery<
Witchery is a magical mod. It has it's own in-game documentation. To access it, type "Witchcraft" into NEI and then 
obtain the books shown. The first one you will want to get is "Herbology" and then "Collectign Fumes." From there on it 
is self-explanatory.~

>WRCBE, Wireless Redstone - CBE<
At it's core Wireless Redstone ChickenBones Edition (WR-CBE) is a very simple mod; it allows you to wirelessly transmit 
redstone signals. It even works across dimensions!~
~
For the items besides the wireless transmitter/receiver and the wireless remote I reccomend you check out ChickenBones' 
Minecraft Forum page. He also describes SMP permissions commands on that post. However, The items stated above (the 
only ones you will likely use) will be explained on the following page(s).
~~~
Wireless Transmitter/Receiver~
~
Right click on the block to open the inventory. You can set a frequency for the redstone signal to transmit/receive from. 
You can also access the advanced tab from here.~
~
In the advanced tab you will notice that you can add/remove names whick you can link to certain frequencies. This makes it 
simple to remember what your different frequencies do and it is easy to switch back and forth between them.~
~
On the right you will notice a GUI that says Phase shift and some arrows. This allows you to color some frequencies with 
vanilla dyes. Note: This is purely for easy identification, it does not affect the technical properties!
~~~
Extra Info:~
~
The wireless remote is simply a portable wireless transmitter. It's gui can be opened by right-clicking.~
~
WR-CBE has ComputerCraft support. Wrap it as a peripheral and then use peripheral.getFreq(frequency) or 
peripheral.setFreq(Frequency)~

>ZansMinimap, Zan's Minimap<
Zan's Minimap (Voxel Map) provides the player with a convenient mini-map located in the top right hand corner of the 
screen. It provides a variety of features.~
~
Adds an in-game waypoint system (that can show the location of your latest death).~
~
Adds a radar that can show a customizable number of mobs, animals, and players.~
~
The default key to access the menu is "M". There you can customize the look of your mini-map, configure the other keybinds 
for the mod, change the radar/waypoints, and more.~
