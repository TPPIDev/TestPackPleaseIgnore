**This is the file of supported mods and the info to go along with them**
**To add a mod to the file, type >ModCommandName, ModProperName<**
**The ModCommandName cannot have spaces, and will be used to call the mod's info command.**
**The ModProperName can have spaces - this is the "real name" of the mod, to be used in its guidebook title.**
**Example: >ThermalExpansion, Thermal Expansion 3<**
**After that, type any info about the mod. Mod information is naturally separated by the names of mods (inside ><)**
**To just specify a link, use <> (ex. <http://google.com>) and this will be put into the chat instead of a book**
**You CANNOT have a mod's documentation be both a book and a link, due to current limitations of the mod**
**That means, for mods where you want to link to a wiki, the link should be all that's there under it in this**
**documentation file.**
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

***15
Example:
>ModName<
This is some very useful info
and I am typing it on multiple lines 
to make this text file easier to read. 
These lines don't have line breaks between them 
in the book though because they don't end with "~".

Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~

Now I am after a blank line

>TPPITweaks, TPPI Tweaks<
TPPITweaks is the mod made especially for the TPPI Modpack, 
which is the representative modpack for /r/feedthebeast.~
~
It contains many tweaks for mods to better improve balance, 
and some helpful objects to better guide

the player in the modpack.~

>Thaumcraft, Thaumcraft 4<
Thaumcraft is a magical mod that requires you to "research" its items before you can craft them.~
~
There's all kinds of magical swag that you can build and play with, but it's probably best for you to 
learn about it on your own.~
To get started, craft a iron capped wooden wand, 
place a bookshelf on the ground, and right-click your wand on it.~
~
It should transform into a Thaumonomicon; the true guidebook for Thaumcraft!
~
>TinkersConstruct, Tinkers' Construct<
Tinkers' Construct is a mod that lets you build custom tools out of 
various materials, each with their own special properties.~
~
To get started with the basics, check out the book "Materials And You" that 
you should have spawned with.
~
>ThermalExpansion, Thermal Expansion 3<
Thermal Expansion is a "technology" mod that adds a power system called Redstone Flux (RF). 
It has itemducts, fluiducts, and energy conduits for transporting items, liquids, and RF power 
respectively, as well as a bunch of useful blocks for ore processing, automatic crafting, storage, and more.~
~
You can start generating RF power using the mod's dynamos and some energy conduits, with leadstone conduits being the 
lowest tier. 
You can rotate and pick up machines by right clicking and shift right clicking with a Crescent Hammer, 
the mod's version of a wrench.~
~~~
All machines in the mod have their own configuration settings in their GUIs.~
~
The redstone behavior tab lets you choose how the machine will respond to redstone.~
The configuration tab lets you choose where the machine will input and output its products, 
be that energy, liquids, or power, on a per block face basis.~
~
Blue indicates an input on a given face, while orange indicates an output.~
There are other colors used situationally depending on the machine. 
For these, it's best to select that color in the configuration menu, then look 
back at the main GUI of the machine.~
The slot in the machine associated with that color will 
be highlighted in that color. This should help indicate what that color's purpose is 
for that particular machine.
~
>ArsMagica2, Ars Magica 2<
Ars Magica lets players concoct their own unique spells, fight magical bosses, and even double your ores with magic!.~
Many of the spells will have to be discovered through a skill point system. Skill points are gained by fighting
mobs and bosses with magic, trading with villagers, and even exploring.~
Just like Thaumcraft, this mod gives you an Arcane Compendium with every last detail of Ars Magica 
that you could ever want. Head on over to the next page to find out how to make this!~
~~~
Making the Arcane Compendium:~
~
Scattered throughout the world you might find light-blue pools of liquid. You've most likely found liquid essence, a very useful kind of fuel that Ars Magica adds.~
~
Make a 2x2 pool of this liquid, and place a book inside an item frame next to the pool. 
Wood planks work just fine for this.~
After a bit, you'll see mysterious white letters rise out of the pool and fly into the framed book.~
Once the infusion is complete, the book is no longer a boring stack of paper stuck between leather.
It now contains every piece of information you need to become a master of the Arcane Arts!~

>MagicalCrops, Magical Crops<
If you are the kind of player that just hates mining, and would rather farm your diamonds,
Magical Crops is the mod for you!~
This mod adds ways to grow many different resources like coal, redstone, experience, and more!~
Don't you worry though, it's not as easy as you think!
~~~
Getting Started:~
~
During your mining adventures you might come across Essence Ore. Mine this with iron or better to get essence dust!~
You can see what this will be used for in NEI, and it is a very useful material to have.~
While de-grassing the terrain you might get essence seeds as a drop. Lucky you, as this is a rare chance.~
This plant will grow the same essence you get from mining the Essence Ore.~
Head to the next page to learn about how Infusion Stones!~
~~~
Magical Stones:~
~
If you search NEI you'll see there are seeds for every vanilla resource (and modded resources if supported)~
In order to craft the resource seeds you will need infusion stones.~
There are five strengths of stones: Weak, Regular, Strong, Extreme, and Master.~
Each can help you craft resources based on what tier they are in.~
For example, a weak infusion stone cannot craft diamonds.~
Check NEI for the recipies using the infusion stones to craft resources!~
~~~
The Essentials (get it)~
~
Once you have a weak infusion stone and some essence dust, you can craft Weak Essence!~
This, along with the other strengths of essence, is used to craft the seeds for resource crops.~
Take coal seeds for example, they require 4 Coal, 4 Weak Essence, and one seed.~
Harvesting a coal crop will drop Coal essence and 1-2 coal seeds for replanting!~
The mod makes things a bit more challenging, as you'll see on the next page:~
~~~
Stepping Things Up:~
~
Weak Essence may be easy to get, but to make one piece of Regular Essence, you need a
Regular Infusion stone and four weak essence!~
This makes sure you can't start growing diamonds in a matter of minutes (or even hours).~
Crops do grow slowly, and you cannot use bonemeal, but there are other ways ;]~
~
You didn't think the mod stopped at merely growing diamonds did you?~
~~~
Food!~
~
That's right, there's even food added to the game! You'll find all sorts of seeds like
sweetcorn, chilis, grapes, cucumbers, and more by breaking grass!~
This diversifies your kitchen, but there's more!~
You also can make four new stews from pork, mutton, beef, and chicken.~
Is calamari your fancy? How about some nice bouled eggs? Dried flesh? Magical Crops has you covered.~
I didn't even mention juice or super bread...~
~~~
Juiced Up!~
~
By infusing bread with various essences, you get super bread! Chomp down on a piece to find out what
magical abilities you'll gain.~
Besides bread, you can use a Juicer to make, well, juice!~
Each bottle of juice restores 3 hunger except for Berry Blast, which is 4.~
The mod doesn't stop at food, for those that like options while building, see the next page!~
~~~
Infused Blocks:~
~
Smack obsidian essence with blocks and you give them fire and explosion resistance!~
You can do this to clay, wool, and even wood planks.~
House too dark, and don't want to put up ugly torches? Make Light-infused blocks!~
These blocks emit a light level of 14 (glowstone), and you can infuse stone bricks,
planks, and regular stone types.~
Tinting many kinds of blocks is also possible. Want to have a base made of diamond tinted stone bricks? Done.~
~~~
And Finally:~
~ The mod may seem overpowered, but don't worry, the TPPI staff have nerfed it quite a bit.~
Hope you enjoyed this guide, and if you need anything added please let me know!~
