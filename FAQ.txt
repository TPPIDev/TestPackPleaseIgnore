Frequently Asked Questions

Q. What items/blocks/other stuffs are removed that are normally craftable?
A. Auto-Output Upgrade (Advanced Genetics - Prevents crashing) 
Iron->Iridum in the MT (Advanced Solars - Balance) 
Titanium->Chrome in the MT (Advanced Solars - Balance)
Spatial IO stuff (AE - Unstable)
Bibliocraft can only make 2 copies using one plate and uses more XP (Balance, discourages exploit)
Pixies and Phantom mobs are disabled (BoP)
Force Shears (Dartcraft - Prevents crash on servers)
Portal Guns cannot be found in dungeon loot, you must craft it (Portal Gun - Balance)
Hammering of non-basic plates using the forge hammer is disabled (Gregtech/IC2 - Basic=Gold, Iron, Copper, etc.. Non-basic=Stainless Steel, Titanium, etc.. Balance)
Uncrafting Table (Twilight Forest - Prevents known and probably unknown exploits)
Power requirement for LP is off (Encourages it over AE)
Morph Abilities are off (Use Advanced Genetics)
Steam Turbine and Biofuel Generator (MFR - balance due to a bug with it accepting any liquids. Will be renabled when fixed)
Project:RED mechanical module (Identical to LP..)
Wither Upgrade (Remote IO - Use ender chests/tesseracts)
Time Torch (Dartcraft - Balance)
Repair enchantment on infusing Dartcraft stuff (Balance - Repair isn’t intended for everything and shouldn’t be able to be applied on these extremely powerful weapons/armour)
All AM2 mobs except Mana Creepers are disabled (Lag, annoyance. To summon nature guardian, we added a recipe for its spawn egg)
Removed Flight from Advanced Genetics (Obvious balance reasons - controversial, but necessary to keep various mod items from being made completely obsolete)
Removed More Health Option from Advanced Genetics (Stacks improperly with TiC hearts, leading to massive amounts of health)
Ethereal Processor from ElectroMagicTools (Prevents dupes with GT)

There may be more, but this is all I can see/remember for now.

Q. Why isn’t mod x included?
A. Full, official list will be released at a later date.
